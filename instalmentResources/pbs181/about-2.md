Starting in early 2025, larger Programming by Stealh series is exploring the use of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) in general for hosting client-side web apps and statically generated websites in general, and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)-based sites in particular. This site is being built as a worked example throughout this series-within-a-series.
