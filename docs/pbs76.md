# PBS 76 of X ‚Äî AJAX with jQuery

Having laid a very strong foundation in [the previous instalment](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs75), we‚Äôre now ready to learn how to make HTTP requests with JavaScript using a technique known as AJAX.

We‚Äôll start our journey into AJAX using more traditional JavaScript techniques, i.e. we‚Äôll use callbacks to handle HTTP responses. As we‚Äôll discover, this works very well for single AJAX requests, but the model really starts to get complicated when you have multiple interdependent requests. We won‚Äôt complicate things in this instalment though ‚Äî we‚Äôll start with just simple stand-alone requests this time.

## Before we Get Started ‚Äî A Note on the Bootstrap Grid and Bootstrap Flex Utilities

While working on the challenge set back in instalment 74, a few listeners ran into the same issue ‚Äî confusion between the [Bootstrap Grid classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/grid/), specifically the `col` classes, and the [Bootstrap Flex Utility classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/utilities/flex/), specifically `justify-content-around`.

The way I think of this is that the grid and the flex utilities are different species. You use the grid classes to lay out the big chunks of your page, and you use the flex classes to turn a single tag into a flex container and control how the flex items within it behave. If you find yourself using a flex utility class like `justify-content-around` on a tag that doesn‚Äôt also have the class `d-flex`, you need to stop and think, because you‚Äôre in dangerous territory.

What complicates this a little bit, and why it‚Äôs dangerous territory rather than simply categorically wrong, is that there is one context where the grid and the flex utilities meet and can live together in harmony ‚Äî the grid row.

The reason for this is that under the hood, Bootstrap implements grid rows as flex containers (they get the CSS attribute `display: flex`).

So, my final advice is this: **if you‚Äôre using a Bootstrap Flex utility class in a tag that does not also have the Bootstrap class `d-flex` or `row`, you‚Äôre probably doing something wrong.**

## PBS 74 Challenge Solution

Back in instalment 74, I set a challenge to use Mustache templates to build a flexbox-based contacts listing using a given file as a starting point.

In PBS 75, I offered a tip to help with the challenge. In that tip I suggested building the template before building your view object. So I‚Äôm going to follow my own advice in this sample solution.

But before starting any real work, I needed to do a little housekeeping. I started by updating the jumbotron text to better describe the page:

```html
<header class="container mt-5">
  <div class="jumbotron">
    <h1 class="display-4">Contact the Hosts<br><small class="text-muted">PBS 74 Challenge</small></h1>

    <p class="lead">Bart's sample solution to the challenge set in <a href="https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/2019/03/24/pbs-74-of-x-more-mustaches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instalment 74</a> of the <a href="https://bartb.ie/pbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Programming by Stealth series</a>.</p>
  </div>
</header>
```

Next, I updated the main body of the page to include a placeholder into which the contact cards can later be added:

```html
<main class="container mb-5">
  <div class="row mb-4">
    <div class="col">
      <p>You can use the links below to contact the hosts of the Programming by Stealth podcast series.</p>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row" id="contact_cards"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</main>
```

I‚Äôve highlighted the node into which I‚Äôll be injecting the contact cards. Note that it‚Äôs a Bootstrap grid row, and that it has the ID `contact_cards`. This means that the individual contact cards must be Bootstrap grid columns.

### Step 1 ‚Äî Build a Basic Template & any Needed Partials

At this point I knew where in the document I‚Äôd be injecting my contact cards. So I could now do a first pass at my template. In keeping with Bootstrap best practices, I started by building a template aimed at the smallest breakpoint (`xs`):

<!-- {% raw %} -->
```html
<!-- The Mustache Template for a Contact Card -->
<script type="text/html" id="contact_card_tpl">
  <nav class="col-12 mb-3 p-2">
    <h1 class="h5">Contact {{name.first}}</h1>
    <div class="d-flex flex-column">
      {{# contactMethods}}
      <div class="p-1">
        <span class="d-inline-block" style="width: 1.5em;">{{> icon}}</span>
        <span>{{value}}</span>
      </div>
      {{/ contactMethods}}
    </div>
  </nav>
</script>
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

Some key points to note:

1.  Because these contact cards are likely to end up being big collections of links, I felt `<nav>` was the most appropriate HTML semantic tag to use.
2.  The `<nav>` is a full-width Bootstrap grid column (`col-12`), has medium bottom margin (`mb-3`), and a medium small padding (`p-2`).
3.  Each card consists of two top-level elements:
    1.  A top-level title (`<h1>`) containing the person‚Äôs first name `{% raw %}{{{name.first}}}{% endraw %}`. Semantically this is the top level heading within the `<nav>`, so `<h1>` is the appropriate tag. But it will look much too big, so note the use of Bootstrap‚Äôs `h5` utility tag to render it smaller.
    2.  A flex container (`d-flex`) containing a Mustache loop over an array named `contactMethods`. The assignment explicitly required Bootstrap‚Äôs flex utilities be used. By default flex boxes display horizontally, but they can also stack items vertically. That‚Äôs a much better fit here, hence the use of `flex-column`.
4.  Each contact item within the card is represented by a `div`. Remember that, by virtue of being direct children of a flex container, these `<div>`s are flex items. I gave each contact item a small amount of padding (`p1`).
5.  Each contact item contains two `span`s, one for the icon, and one for the text (`{% raw %}{{value}}{% endraw %}`). Note that the icon is rendered with a partial named `icon`.
6.  To ensure all the text aligns nicely, I converted the `span`s containing the icons into inline blocks with `d-inline-block`, and gave them a fixed width of one and a half characters with the inline style attribute `style="width: 1.5em;"`. The reason for converting the `span`s from their default `inline` display to `inline-block` is so that they have a `width` property.

Finally, there is a little more markup to look at in the definition of the `icon` partial:

```javascript
{% raw %}// define any needed partials
const partials = {
  icon: '<i class="{{{icon.classes}}}" title="{{{icon.title}}}" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">{{{icon.title}}}</span>'
};{% endraw %}
```

Note that this partial makes use of a view variable named `icon` which is an object containing at least two keys:

<dl>
<dt><code>classes</code></dt>

<dd>The CSS classes for the Font Awesome icon.</dd>

<dt><code>title</code></dt>

<dd>The text to use as the tooltip for sighted visitors, and the alternative text for screen readers.</dd>
</dl>

The icon consists of two parts; an `<i>` tag forms the visible icon and is hidden from screen readers with `aria-hidden="true"`, while a `<span>` provides a label that is visible only to screen readers with the `sr-only` class.

The template and partials together define the form of the view objects will need to take. I did not write my templates to match a pre-existing view. I wrote my template so it reads well, and then that determined the shape of the view objects I needed to build.

This is the structure imposed by my template and partials:

```javascript
{
  name: { // an object
    first: 'A FIRST NAME' // e.g. 'Allison'
  },
  contactMethods: [ // an array of objects, one for each contact method
    // ‚Ä¶
    {
      name: 'A CONTACT METHOD NAME', // e.g. 'twitter'
      value: 'THE VALUE FOR THE CONTACT METHOD' // e.g. 'podfeet'
      icon: { // an object
        classes: 'FONT AWESOME CLASSES', // e.g. 'fab fa-twitter'
        title: 'A TITLE FOR ACCESSABILITY', // e.g. 'twitter'
      }
    },
    // ‚Ä¶
  ]
}
```

### Step 2 ‚Äî Build the View Objects from the JSON Data

To actually see the template and partials in action, I now needed to write a document ready handler to perform the following four tasks:

1.  Read the template from the `<script>` tag within which it is defined.
2.  Read and parse the JSON data from the `<script>` tag within which it is defined.
3.  Build a view object for each person matching the structure above.
4.  Use Mustache to render the contact cards and inject them into the page using jQuery.

```javascript
// document ready handler
$(function(){
  // fetch the contact card template
  const contactTpl = $('#contact_card_tpl').html();

  // fetch the data from the json  string
  data = JSON.parse($('#pbs74_view_data').text());


  // build the view objects
  const people = [];
  for(const uname of Object.keys(data.people).sort()){
    const person = {
      name: data.people[uname].name,
      contactMethods: []
    };
    for(const contactName of Object.keys(data.people[uname].contact).sort()){
      const contactVal = data.people[uname].contact[contactName];
      person.contactMethods.push({
        name: contactName,
        value: contactVal,
        icon: {
          classes: data.contactIcons[contactName],
          title: contactName
        }
      });
    }
    people.push(person);
  }
  //console.log('generated view objects:', people);
  //window.alert('generated view objects:\n' + JSON.stringify(people, null, 2));

  // render the contact cards
  const $contactCardHolder = $('#contact_cards');
  for(const person of people){
    $contactCardHolder.append(Mustache.render(
      contactTpl, // the template
      person, // the view
      partials // the partials
    ));
  }
});
```

The loading of the template and the JSON object are by-the-book, so they are not worth dwelling on.

It‚Äôs worth noting that, to avoid code duplication, I chose to put my call to `Mustache.render()` inside a loop, and to facilitate that I stored my view objects in an array named `people`.

The interesting part of this handler is the building of the view objects. So let‚Äôs dig in a little deeper there.

Note that you might find it easier to follow along if you can see the structure of the view objects generated. You‚Äôll notice two commented-out lines in the code ‚Äî you can uncomment one to render the view objects to the console, or the other to render them as a popup (or both).

Remember that my template and partials have predetermined the structure the view objects will have to take, so we know what we need. We also know what we have in the JSON data, and the two align. The only task remaining was to write the code to construct the needed 'from' objects from the data in the loaded data object.

My code makes use of three JavaScript features we‚Äôve used earlier in this series ‚Äî the `Object.keys()` function (introduced back in [instalment 17](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs17)), the `Array` prototype‚Äôs `.sort()` function (introduced in [instalment 18](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs18)), and the `for...of` loop (introduced in [instalment 45](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs45)).

As a quick reminder:

*   `Object.keys()` returns an object‚Äôs keys as an array of strings.
*   When you call `.sort()` on an array, a new array is returned with the values sorted lexically.
*   A `for...of` loop can be used to loop over an array.

You can follow along by enabling the JavaScript console on the file `pbs74-challenge-solution/basic.html` in this instalment‚Äôs ZIP. To make it easier to do this, I made sure to define the variable `data` in the global scope. That way, it can be accessed from the console.

We can access the object defining the data about Allison and Bart at `data.people`. This object is indexed by two keys (`allison` & `bart`). We can get those keys with `Object.keys(data.people)`. For good measure we should sort them, hence the `for...of` loop iterating over `Object.keys(data.people).sort()`.

Given this simple `for...of` loop, we can log all the keys in the `data.people` object in alphabetical order (try it in the JavaScript console):

```javascript
for(const uname of Object.keys(data.people).sort()){
  console.log(uname);
}
```

Note that within this loop we can access the relevant person‚Äôs details via `data.people[uname]`. For example the following loop will log both people‚Äôs full names (try it in the JavaScript console):

```javascript
for(const uname of Object.keys(data.people).sort()){
  console.log(`${data.people[uname].name.first} ${data.people[uname].name.last}`);
}
```

So, my code builds the needed array of view objects by looping over the keys in `data.people`. Within the loop it builds an object for each person named `person` and, when that object is complete, adds it to the end of the `people` array.

My code starts to build each person object by creating an object with just the two needed top-level keys (`name`, and `contactMethods`):

```javascript
const person = {
  name: data.people[uname].name,
  contactMethods: []
};
```

At this point `person.contactMethods` is an empty array. So the next task is to build the needed objects for each contact method and add them into the array.

As a reminder, each contact method object needs to have the following form (determined by my template and partials):

```javascript
{
  name: 'A CONTACT METHOD NAME', // e.g. 'twitter'
  value: 'THE VALUE FOR THE CONTACT METHOD' // e.g. 'podfeet'
  icon: { // an object
    classes: 'FONT AWESOME CLASSES', // e.g. 'fab fa-twitter'
    title: 'A TITLE FOR ACCESSABILITY', // e.g. 'twitter'
  }
}
```

To build one of these objects for each contact method, I used another `for...of` loop.

If you look at the JSON object, you‚Äôll see that, within each person, there‚Äôs an object named `contact` which represents each piece of contact information as a name-value pair. Again, we‚Äôll need to make use of `Object.keys()` to get at the data we need:

```javascript
for(const contactName of Object.keys(data.people[uname].contact).sort()){
  const contactVal = data.people[uname].contact[contactName];
  person.contactMethods.push({
    name: contactName,
    value: contactVal,
    icon: {
      classes: data.contactIcons[contactName],
      title: contactName
    }
  });
}
```

The important subtlety to note is that the keys in each person‚Äôs `contact` object match the keys in `data.contactIcons`. Hence it‚Äôs possible to use `data.conctactIcons` as a _lookup table_ to get the CSS classes for each piece of contact information (`data.contactIcons[contactName]`).

Well, that was a lot of work, but we can finally see our first draft of our contact card:

![](../assets/pbs76/Screenshot-2019-04-18-at-10.44.08.png)

### Step 3 ‚Äî Tweak the Template

That looks fine at the smallest break point, but it does start to look a bit ridiculous as larger breakpoints. So, I needed to allow the cards to go side-by-side from `lg` up. I did that by simply adding `col-lg-6` to the `<nav>` in the template.

That actually worked pretty well:

![](../assets/pbs76/Screenshot-2019-04-18-at-11.51.04.png)

That did leave the very silly situation where there were things displayed that are obviously links, but were not actually clickable. I felt I couldn‚Äôt leave things there, so I made another tweak to my code.

My first step was expand my view generation code a little and add a test to check whether or not the value for a given contact method was a URL or not. For example `'podfeet'` is not a URL, but `'https://www.podfeet.com'` is.

I chose to use a regular expression in combination with the `.match()` function from the `String` prototype ([relevant docs available here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match)).

```javascript
const valIsURL = contactVal.match(/^http(s)?[:]\/\//);
```

The RE takes a little unpacking. The `^` means `start of string`, `()` defines a `group`, in this case just the letter `s`. That group is made optional with the addition of the `?` which means _zero or one of_. This is how my RE supports both `http://` and `https://` URLs. The character class `[:]` simply matches the `:` symbol. I had to remember to escape the `/` character with `\/`.

Next I defined a partial for rendering a link:

```javascript
{% raw %}const partials = {
  icon: '<i class="{{{icon.classes}}}" title="{{{icon.title}}}" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">{{{icon.title}}}</span>',
  link: '<a href="{{{link.url}}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{{link.text}}</a>'
};{% endraw %}
```

This partial imposes more structure on the view objects ‚Äî the links must be added to the view as object of the form:

```javascript
{
  url: 'https://SOMEDOMAN.TLD/‚Ä¶',
  text: 'THE VISIBLE LINK TEXT'
}
```

With the partial created and named (`link`), I could update my template to make use of it. This updated template only renders a clickable link when the contact method object contains a link object:

<!-- {% raw %} -->
```html
<!-- The Mustache Template for a Contact Card -->
<script type="text/html" id="contact_card_tpl">
  <nav class="col-12 col-lg-6 mb-3 p-2">
    <h1 class="h5">Contact {{name.first}}</h1>
    <div class="d-flex flex-column">
      {{# contactMethods}}
      <div class="p-1">
        <span class="d-inline-block" style="width: 1.5em;">{{> icon}}</span>
        {{# link}}
        <span>{{> link}}</span>
        {{/ link}}
        {{^ link}}
        <span>{{value}}</span>
        {{/ link}}
      </div>
      {{/ contactMethods}}
    </div>
  </nav>
</script>
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

Finally, I updated my view creation code to inject the needed link objects when the RE matched the value for the contact method being processed.:

```javascript
{% raw %}// build the view objects
const people = [];
for(const uname of Object.keys(data.people).sort()){
  const person = {
    name: data.people[uname].name,
    contactMethods: []
  };
  for(const contactName of Object.keys(data.people[uname].contact).sort()){
    const contactVal = data.people[uname].contact[contactName];
    const valIsURL = contactVal.match(/^http(s)?[:]\/\//);
    let link = false;
    if(valIsURL){
      link = {
        url: contactVal,
        text: contactVal
       };
    }
    person.contactMethods.push({
      name: contactName,
      value: contactVal,
      icon: {
        classes: data.contactIcons[contactName],
        title: contactName
      },
      link: link
    });
  }
  people.push(person);
  //console.log('generated view objects:', people);
  //window.alert('generated view objects:\n' + JSON.stringify(people, null, 2));
}{% endraw %}
```

And that‚Äôs that! This sample solution now meets all the criteria set out in the challenge, so full marks!

## Optional Extra Credit ‚Äî Advanced Challenge Solution

I got a little carried away, and wasn‚Äôt happy to leave things there. I went on to create a more advanced sample solution that addressed two shortcomings in my original solution:

1.  I wanted every contact item to become a link, and to have link text that‚Äôs more appropriate for the relevant contact type. For example I wanted the twitter name to be rendered with an `@` prefixed, and to be a link to the actual Twitter profile.
2.  I wanted a nicer layout at larger sizes ‚Äî a horizontal arrangement of large icons with text and a link centred below them.

Basically, I wanted to achieve this:

![](../assets/pbs76/Screenshot-2019-04-18-at-12.25.13.png)

### Extra Credit 1 ‚Äî Data Transformer Lookups

For all the contact methods, there is actually enough information provided to create a nice link. We just need to transform what we have into what we need.

We could write a separate function for each contact type, name it, and then have a great big `if`‚Äì`else`‚Äì`if` or `case` statement to select the correct function, but the code would be extremely unwieldy!

How could we do it better? We could adapt the lookup table idea used in `data.contactIcons`. Instead of mapping the names of the contact items (`twitter` etc.) to strings, we could map them to anonymous functions. These will be tiny little functions, so they can be most easily written as ES6 _fat arrow_ (or just _arrow_) functions.

In some cases we won‚Äôt need to do any transformation at all. So to save code duplication I first created a function to simply return whatever is passed:

```javascript
const passthrough = function(val){
 return val;
};
```

We can rewrite this traditional function as an _arrow function_ like so:

```javascript
const passthrough = (val)=>{ return val; };
```

Many of these little transformation functions will depend on using regular expressions with the `.replace()` function from the `String` prototype ([docs available here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace)). This function takes two arguments, a regular expression to match, and a replacement string. The replacement string can insert capture groups from the RE by using the special strings `$1`, `$2` etc..

As a practical example, let‚Äôs look at a function for transforming the Stack Overflow URL into a stack overflow username. The URLs take the form `https://stackoverflow.com/users/USER_ID/USERNAME?tab=profile` where `USER_ID` is a number, and `USERNAME` is the text we want to extract. For example, `https://stackoverflow.com/users/174985/bart-b?tab=profile` has the user ID `174985` and the username `bart-b`.

This is the relevant arrow function:

```javascript
(val)=>{ return val.replace(/^http(?:s)?[:]\/\/stackoverflow[.]com\/users\/\d+\/(.+)[?]tab=profile$/, '$1'); }
```

A lot to absorb, but let's step through it like we did with the `.match()` RE earlier.

Notice the first part of the RE is identical to what we had before. It matches the start of the string followed by `http://` or `https://` using a non-capturing group to make the `s` optional. This is important, because it means the `s` is not in `$1`. If we‚Äôd just used regular parentheses, we‚Äôd have created a capturing group. Then the matched value, `'s'` or an empty string in this case, would have been stored in `$1`.

We then match the string `'stackoverflow.com/users/'`, remembering to escape the `/` characters with `\/`, and using the character class `[.]` to represent an actual period symbol. Remember, were it not in the character class, the `.` would mean _‚Äòany single character‚Äô_. Then we match one or more digits followed by a `/` with `/\d+\/`. Next comes the really important part ‚Äî the capture group for the username: `(.+)`. Remember, `.` means _‚Äòany character‚Äô_, `+` means _‚Äòone or more‚Äô_, and parentheses create a capture group. So we are capturing one or more of any character, and storing that value in the first capture group, which we can access in the replacement string as `$1`. We don‚Äôt want to include the trailing ?tab=profile in the capture group. So we have to match that outside the parentheses. Because `?` means _‚Äòzero or one‚Äô_, I use the character class `[?]` to match the actual question mark symbol, and `$` means `'end of string'`. Finally, the replacement string (second argument to `.replace()`) is simply `'$1'`, i.e. the contents of the first (and only) capture group.

Putting it all together I created two lookup tables, one defining functions for transforming the raw values (the keys from `data.people.allison.contact` and `data.people.bart.contact`) into URLs, and one for transforming them into meaningful text for the links. I added my lookup tables into the `data` object for easy access:

```javascript
// inject helper functions for generating pretty values
// and URLs for each contact type into the data structure
const passthrough = (val)=>{ return val; };
data.prettyValueGenerators = {
  "email": passthrough,
  "facebook": (val)=>{ return val.replace(/^http(?:s)?[:]\/\/www.facebook.com\//, ''); },
  "flickr": passthrough,
  "slack": passthrough,
  "stackOverflow": (val)=>{ return val.replace(/^http(?:s)?[:]\/\/stackoverflow[.]com\/users\/\d+\/(.+)[?]tab=profile$/, '$1'); },
  "twitter": (val)=>{ return `@${val}`; },
  "url": (val)=>{ return val.replace(/^http(?:s)?[:]\/\//, '').replace(/\/$/, ''); }
};
data.urlGenerators = {
  "email": (val)=>{ return `mailto:${val}`; },
  "facebook": passthrough,
  "flickr": (val)=>{ return `https://flickr.com/people/${val}`; },
  "slack": (val)=>{ return `https://${val}.slack.com/`; },
  "stackOverflow": passthrough,
  "twitter": (val)=>{ return `https://twitter.com/${val}`; },
  "url": passthrough
};
```

You can see these functions in action by opening the JavaScript console on `pbs74-challenge-solution/advanced.html` from the ZIP file and entering:

```javascript
data.prettyValueGenerators.twitter('podfeet');
data.urlGenerators.twitter('podfeet');
```

We now know that our view will always have link information within it. So we can remove the condition where there is no link from the template and simply assume there will always be one. The `<span>` containing the visible text becomes just `{% raw %}{{> link}}{% endraw %}`.

We also need to update our code for generating the view objects to use our new lookup tables:

```javascript
// build the view objects
{% raw %}const people = [];
for(const uname of Object.keys(data.people).sort()){
  const person = {
    name: data.people[uname].name,
    contactMethods: []
  };
  for(const contactName of Object.keys(data.people[uname].contact).sort()){
    const contactVal = data.people[uname].contact[contactName];
    person.contactMethods.push({
      name: contactName,
      value: contactVal,
      link: {
        url: data.urlGenerators[contactName](contactVal),
        text: data.prettyValueGenerators[contactName](contactVal)
      },
      icon: {
        classes: data.contactIcons[contactName],
        title: contactName
      }
    });
  }
  people.push(person);
  //console.log('generated view objects:', people);
  //window.alert('generated view objects:\n' + JSON.stringify(people, null, 2));
}{% endraw %}
```

That takes care of my first desire ‚Äî nicer links.

### Extra Credit 2 ‚Äî A More Responsive Layout

Now that the text for each contact type has been shortened, it becomes much more practical to have them side-by-side instead of one under the other at larger screen sizes. For that to look good, the icons need to become much bigger, and be located above the text.

Before starting that though, the shorter text also means we can move the two cards side-by-side even at the `sm` breakpoint. So let‚Äôs start by replacing `col-lg-6` with `col-sm-6`.

OK, now let‚Äôs move on to making the side-by-side icons from the `md` breakpoint up.

Firstly, for side-by-side to work, each card needs to become full width again at the `md` breakpoint. So we need to add `col-md-12`, giving us `col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-12`.

Secondly, since there are no responsive size classes, the easiest way to achieve different icon sizes at different breakpoints is with separate icons, a big one and a small one, one of which is always hidden.

We want our existing small icon to be visible for breakpoints `sx` and `sm`, but be hidden from `md` up. So we start by adding `d-md-none` to that span:

<!-- {% raw %} -->
```html
<span class="d-inline-block d-md-none" style="width: 1.5em;">{{> icon}}</span>
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

Next we add a new larger icon which should be hidden for breakpoints `xs` and `sm`, then become visible from `md` up:

<!-- {% raw %} -->
```html
<div class="d-none d-md-block text-center h1">
  {{> icon}}
</div>
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

Note that I‚Äôve made the icon large using the `h1` Bootstrap utility class.

Also note that the existence of the `icon` partial has saved me from some code duplication.

We‚Äôre now ready to make the flex container switch from vertical stacking to horizontal stacking from the `md` breakpoint up. We do this by adding the Bootstrap flex utility class `flex-md-row`. To allow any icons with long text to flow onto a possible extra row if needed, we add `flex-md-wrap`. To align the items nicely, we add `justify-content-md-between`.

We‚Äôre almost there, but we still need to centre the icons and text, and also centre the heading containing the person‚Äôs name. We can do all this with the responsive Bootstrap utility class `text-md-center`.

Putting it all together, my updated template becomes:

<!-- {% raw %} -->
```html
<!-- The Mustache Template for a Contact Card -->
<script type="text/html" id="contact_card_tpl">
  <nav class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-12 mb-3 p-2">
    <h1 class="h5 text-md-center">Contact {{name.first}}</h1>
    <div class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row flex-md-wrap justify-content-md-between">
      {{# contactMethods}}
      <div class="p-1">
        <div class="d-none d-md-block text-center h1">
          {{> icon}}
        </div>
        <span class="d-inline-block d-md-none" style="width: 1.5em;">{{> icon}}</span>
        <span class="d-md-block text-md-center">{{> link}}</span>
      </div>
      {{/ contactMethods}}
    </div>
  </nav>
</script>
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

## AJAX ‚Äî Asynchronous HTTP Requests with JavaScript

AJAX is technically an acronym: _Asynchronous JavaScript and XML_. Don‚Äôt get too hung up on this though. The XML part isn‚Äôt really relevant to our experience of actually using AJAX as a JavaScript developer. The two words within that _backronym_ that really do matter are `Asynchronous` and `JavaScript`.

The JavaScript part is obvious, but the _asynchronous_ part may not be.

When a chunk of code executes synchronously, each statement happens in turn, one after the other, starting with the first and ending with the last. Synchronously executing code always happens in the same order, one line after the next line, after the next. No two lines of synchronous code are ever executing at the same time.

Synchronous code is easy to write, easy to understand, and makes up the vast bulk of our code. However, there are times when synchronicity becomes problematic. Network IO (input/output) is a classic example of this. Another term for describing synchronous IO is _blocking IO_. Simply put, in computer time, it takes an absolute eon to get a response from a web server. If you execute such requests synchronously then they block execution of the rest of your code while they wait. If we used blocking IO for HTTP requests in JavaScript, we‚Äôd end up with utterly unusable web apps that repeatedly hang for seconds at a time! Simply put, synchronous network IO does not work!

If we can‚Äôt do things synchronously, then we have to do them asynchronously, or, to put it another way, we have to use non-blocking network IO when making using JavaScript to make HTTP requests.

With asynchronous network IO, execution doesn‚Äôt wait when an HTTP request is made. Instead, it continues to the next line of code as soon as the request is started. We need to use some kind of event handler to react when the request finally finishes and we have a response from the server.

The original mechanism for asynchronous programming in JavaScript is _callbacks_. In fact, we‚Äôve been doing asynchronous programming within this series for a long time. All event handlers are asynchronous, as are all timeouts and intervals.

More recent versions of JavaScript have completely reimagined asynchronous programming through the adoption of so-called _promises_, and the `async` and `await` keywords.

Because we‚Äôre already familiar with callbacks, we‚Äôll start our exploration of AJAX using this older approach, but we‚Äôll shortly use AJAX as a reason to learn about promises. What will become apparent soon is that callbacks come with some serious limitations, so much so that you‚Äôll often hear JavaScript developers complain about being stuck in _callback hell_! Promises were invented to free developers from callback hell. So once we‚Äôve spent a little time there, we‚Äôll be well motivated to learn all about promises üôÇ

So, in summary, AJAX is nothing more or less than a mechanism for asynchronously making HTTP requests with JavaScript.

## The Same Origin Policy

For extremely sound security reasons, browsers prevent JavaScript from making AJAX requests to URLs that don‚Äôt share the same HTTP scheme, domain, and port number as the page the code is executing on. That sounds complicated, but what it means in practice is that you can‚Äôt use AJAX to fetch data from an `http://` URL if the JavaScript making the request is at an `https://` url, and _vice-versa_. It also means that, if your JavaScript is running in a page served from port 80, it can‚Äôt make an AJAX call to port 8080. Finally, it means JavaScript running on `bart.ie` can‚Äôt make AJAX calls to URLs on `podfeet.com`. Do note that sub-domains are OK, so code on `bartb.ie` could make an AJAX call to a URL at `scripts.bartb.ie`.

In the past the block on cross-origin AJAX was absolute, but that is not true anymore. There are legitimate reasons for a developer to wish to make a web service on one domain available from another. Modern browsers now all support a mechanism whereby the owner of a web server can choose to allow AJAX queries from other domains access their URLs. The mechanism is known as [CORS](https://enable-cors.org/) (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), and relies on the server including the HTTP response header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to specify the domains from which cross-origin AJAX requests should be permitted by the browser. Wildcards are allowed, so the author of a web service designed to be used from anywhere on the internet can configure their server to send the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.

Also for security reasons, modern browsers will not allow JavaScript running on a page with a `file://` URL to make any AJAX queries at all. For this reason you‚Äôll need to use your local web server for all our AJAX examples. That way the URL will be `http://localhost‚Ä¶` rather than `file://‚Ä¶`.

## jQuery‚Äôs `$.ajax()` Function

**Important Note:** there are two flavours of jQuery, the full-featured flavour, and the _slim_ flavour. The slim flavour contains only the core jQuery features, and does not include some of jQuery‚Äôs more advanced features, including AJAX support! So, if you want to use AJAX with jQuery, make sure the version you are using does not contain `slim` in the URL/filename. When fetching the jQuery include code from jQuery‚Äôs CDN ([https://code.jquery.com/](https://code.jquery.com/)), the flavour you want is the one labeled **minified**.

Because we‚Äôre familiar with jQuery, and have been using it throughout this series, we‚Äôll be using jQuery‚Äôs AJAX features to make our HTTP requests. As with everything else jQuery does, the same functionality is available in raw JavaScript. I just don‚Äôt find the native implementation to be as nice to use.

jQuery provides multiple AJAX functions, but under the hood, all of them are just wrappers for jQuery‚Äôs primary AJAX function, `$.ajax()`. Until you understand `$.ajax()`, it won‚Äôt be clear what shortcuts/conveniences the other functions provide. So we‚Äôll start our exploration with `$.ajax()`.

As with so many jQuery functions, the `$.ajax()` function can be called with a number of different combinations of arguments. We‚Äôll be using the function in its simplest single-argument form. The single argument we‚Äôll be passing is a dictionary (plain object) of options.

Note that `$.ajax()` is an extremely feature-rich function that supports an impressive array of options. So as usual, our exploration of this function won‚Äôt be exhaustive. To see everything this function can do, check out [the relevant page on jQuery‚Äôs documentation site](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/).

`$.ajax()` returns a `jqXHR` object. This is a special kind of object jQuery uses to represent both the HTTP request and response associated with an AJAX call. This is an extremely powerful object that bundles an impressive array of features. For now, we‚Äôre just interested in the following few properties and functions:

<dl>
<dt><code>.status</code></dt>

<dd>The HTTP response status code as a number, e.g. <code>404</code>.</dd>

<dt><code>.statusText</code></dt>

<dd>The full HTTP response status code as a string, e.g. <code>'404 Not Found'</code>.</dd>

<dt><code>.getAllResponseHeaders()</code></dt>

<dd>Returns all HTTP response headers as a string, one header per line or <code>null</code> if the response has not been received from the server yet.</dd>

<dt><code>.getResponseHeader(headerName)</code></dt>

<dd>Returns the value for the given HTTP response header as a string, or <code>null</code> if the response has not been received from the server yet, or if the response did not contain the specified header.</dd>
</dl>

Again, just a reminder that the above is just a tiny subset of the features provided by `jqXHR` objects. You can get all the details from [the relevant section of the jQuery documentation](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR).

With all that said, let‚Äôs get stuck in! Rather than describing each option in the abstract, let‚Äôs start with an example:

```javascript
// make the AJAX call
const myAjaxRequest = $.ajax({
  url: 'https://www.bartbusschots.ie/utils/fakerWS/numberBetween', // REQUIRED
  method: 'GET', // the HTTP method to use, defaults to GET
  cache: false, // whether or not to allow caching, defaults to true
  data: { // the form data to send to the server as a dictionary
    arg1: $minTB.val(),
    arg2: $maxTB.val()
  },
  dataType: 'text', // one of 'text', 'html', or 'json' (for now)
  error: function(jqXHRObj, statusText, errorText){
    // A callback executed on error.
    // First arg is the jqXHR object representing the AJAX request.
    // Second arg is the HTTP status string.
    // Third arg is an error string.
    window.alert(`AJAX call failed (status: ${statusText}) with error: ${errorText}`);
  },
  success: function(data, statusText, jqXHRObj){
    // A callback executed on success.
    // First arg is the data returned by the server.
    // Second arg is the HTTP status string (almost always '200 OK').
    // Third arg is the jqXHR object representing the AJAX request.
    window.alert(`AJAX call succeeded (status: ${statusText}), returned:\n\n${data}`);
  },
  complete: function(jqXHRObj, statusText){
    // A callback executed when the request is completed.
    // This callback is executed on success and failure.
    // This callback is executed after .success or .error
    // First arg is the jqXHR object representing the AJAX request.
    // Second arg is the HTTP status string.

    // ...
  }
}); // returns a jqXHR object representing the AJAX request
```

You can see this AJAX call in action by saving `pbs76.html` from the ZIP file to your local web server and accessing it over `http://localhost‚Ä¶`. Each time you click the button, the submit handler on the form will fire which will trigger the AJAX call above.

Note that `https://www.bartbusschots.ie/utils/fakerWS` is a web service I wrote that uses the open-source [Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker#fakerproviderbase) PHP module to generate random data of various different kinds. If you‚Äôre curious how my web service works, I‚Äôve open-sourced the code. You can [get it on GitHub](https://github.com/bbusschots/faker-ws.php).

As you can see, the first few options can be easily matched to what we learned last time about HTTP requests. The first one that doesn‚Äôt is `cache`. This is a very convenient jQuery feature that adds an HTTP query parameter named `_` with a random number as the value to the end of the URL. This forces the URL to be different each time, preventing all caching regardless of what your ISP may be doing to save bandwidth.

The `data` option allows you to specify name-value data pairs for sending to the server. When the method is `GET`, jQuery adds the data as query parameters. When the method is `POST`, it adds the data as form inputs.

The `dataType` option is a purely jQuery thing. It tells jQuery what preprocessing to apply to the returned data before calling the event handlers. Setting `dataType` to `'text'` tells jQuery not to do any preprocessing and to just pass the data to the callbacks as a string. Setting the `dataType` to `'html'` would cause jQuery to convert the string into a jQuery object using the `$()` function. Setting `dataType` to `'json'` would cause jQuery to convert the value to a JavaScript object/array using `JSON.parse()`. These are useful conveniences.

Finally, `error`, `success`, and `complete` are callbacks which jQuery will execute when the HTTP request completes. If the request completes successfully, jQuery will execute `success` and then `complete`. If the request fails, jQuery will execute `error` and then `complete`.

## A Challenge

Use either your solution to the previous challenge or my sample solution as your starting point (you‚Äôll find a vision of my sample solution with the correct jQuery import in this instalment‚Äôs ZIP file as `pbs76-challenge-startingPoint/index.html`). If you‚Äôre using your own solution as your starting point, be sure to update the jQuery import line so it does not use the _slim_ flavour!

Create a new file named `contacts.tpl.txt` and save it to the same folder as your HTML file (within your web server‚Äôs document root). Copy the contents of the `<script>` tag containing your Mustache template (not including the `<script>` tag itself) into this new file and save it. Then remove the `<script>` tag from your HTML file.

Update your JavaScript code so it loads the template from the separate file using `$.ajax()`.

For bonus credit, can you do something similar with the `<script>` tag containing the JSON data? This is not as simple as it may seem because you‚Äôll need to make two AJAX requests, both of which will need to succeed, before you can render your contact cards.

## Final Thoughts

We‚Äôll start the next instalment by looking at the complexities of juggling multiple AJAX calls that are interdependent on each other. What we‚Äôll soon discover is that using callbacks for AJAX is hellish! At that stage we‚Äôll be ready to learn about JavaScript promises, a very cool new feature added to the language with the release of ES7.
