In [the previous instalment](./pbs172) we introduced the concept of nesting one or more Git repositories within another using Git Submodules. We explored some common use cases where sunmodules solve real-world problems, but we kept things conceptual and theoretical. In this instalment it's time to get practical, to learn the actual Git commands for working with submodules, and we'll do so using a simplified but common scenario.

## Git Submodules do not Imply Public Repositories

Since recording the first instalment there has been some confusion in the community conflating the concept of consuming one Git repository from within another and public Git repositories. Git can of course be used to work entirely in the open, as illustrated by its wide-spread adoption within the open source community. But Git can be used just as well to share resources within a closed, private community, like a business.

Like Git can be used both within public and private communities, so can Git submodules. To underline that point, all the following scenarios work just fine:

1. A public repo can consume other public repos as submodules
2. A private repo can consume other public repos as submodules
3. A private repo can consume other private repos as submodules
4. A private repo can consume a mix of public and private repos as submodules

When we start to use submodules within the PBS project we'll be working entirely in the open, with all modules involved being public, but that's just one way in which submodules can be used. To underline that point, our imagined scenario for this instalment's examples will take the opposite approach — an entirely private community, an imaginary corporation, using purely private Git repos for purely internal collaboration with Git submodules.

## A Note on Default Git Security Settings

For security reasons, modern versions of Git prevent the use of file paths as Git URLs under some circumstances. Git commands where a human directly enters the file path URL are permitted, but when one Git command triggers others, the triggered commands can't use file path URLs.

When you run afoul of this security default you'll get an error like this:

```text
fatal: transport 'file' not allowed
```

**In the real world,** you're most likely to be working with genuinely remote repositories over SSH or HTTPS, so you're **not likely to encounter this problem**.

However, in order to keep our worked examples in this instalment self-contained, we need to use local folders to simulate remote repositories, so, we will encounter this problem.

The Git setting that controls whether or not file URLs are permitted is `protocol.file.allow`, and it has three possible values:

1. `never` — regardless of context, don't allow file URLs
2. `user` — file URLs are allowed by direct user actions, but not indirectly, i.e. not within a triggered Git command. This is the default.
3. `always` — file URLS can be used in any context, i.e. for direct user actions, and, within any triggered Git commands.

### A Per-Command Exemption (Used in our Examples)

Git's security defaults were added for good reasons, so we want to make the minimal possible exception to facilitate our examples. Rather than setting the configuration globally, we'll set `protocol.file.allow` to `always` (direct and triggered commands) on a per-command basis, and only when we need to. This means that the moment our command and its triggered commands finish, the exception will disappear.

The mechanism for doing this is Git's  `-c` option for passing a value for any configuration variable at run time. The option takes the form `-c NAME_OF_SETTING=VALUE`. To enable file URLs in all contexts we need to add the following to any Git commands that trigger other Git commands:

```
-c protocol.file.allow=always
```

### A Permanent Excemption (Only use if you Regularly use File Path URLs)

It's possible that you want to use submodules in an environment where file-based URLs are the norm. The only realistic example I can think of would be an organisation that hosts its Git repositories on a shared folder that gets mapped as a drive on developer PCs. In such a scenario, you probably want to make a permanent exception, which you can do by updating Git's configuration for the current user with the command `git config --global` command:

```sh
# WARNING - THIS ADDS A PERMANENT SECURITY EXCEPTION
git config --global protocol.file.allow always
```

But remember, this is not recommended!

## A Note on Terminology

Remeber — **submodules are nested repositories**, so **each submodule folder is a Git repository** in its own right.

This means is a real danger of confusion between the all the different repositories at play. 

To illustrate the scale of the possible confusion, consider a repository that has two submodules. You obviously have at least three repos, the three local ones — the primary repo with m the two submodules, and each submodule folder within it. But Git submodules are, by definition, clones of a source repository, so for every submodule there are actually two Git repos in play — the local clone in its folder within your primary repository, and the remote they are linked to. That brings us up to five, but wait, there's more! The primary repo that contains the submodules is itself likely to be cloned from a remote, so now you have **six** repos!

To try keep things clear I'll refer to the primary local repository which contains the submodules as the *outer repo*. I'll refer to the local copies of the consumed remote repositories as *inner repos* or submodules.

## Our Overall Scenario — A Small Web App Business

To explore Git submodules we're going to pretend to be a fledgeling business that builds web apps, all of which share the company's branding.

To keep things consistent across current and future apps, the branding is versioned in its own private Git repository named `pbscorp-brand`. Each web app has its own repo, with names like `pbscorp-app1`. The app repos consume the brand repo as a Git submodule.

To play along, start by downloading the instalment ZIP file, extracting it, opening a terminal in the extracted folder, and executing the initialisation script `initPBS173Demo.sh` with the commands:

```sh
chmod +x *.sh; ./initPBS173Demo.sh
```

This script does the following:

1. Creates parent folders to simulate different   different computers: 
   1. `remote-repos` to represent the company's GIT server
   2. `pc-app1Dev` to represent the PC of a newly hired developer who's just been assigned to app 1
   3. `pc-app2Dev` to represent the PC of a developer tasked with creating the brand-new app 2
   4. `pc-brandDesigner` to represent the PC of a designer tasked with maintaining the brand
2. Expands the bundled repos `pbscorp-brand.bundle` and `pbscorp-app1.bundle` into the bare repositories `pbscorp-brand.git` & `pbscorp-app1.git` in the `remote-repos` folder (the simulated corporate Git server)
3. Creates a complete empty bare repository `pbscorps-app2.git` in the `remote-repos` folder (for use in scenario 2)
4. Clones the `pbscorp-brand.git` repo into the `pc-brandDesigner` folder (for use in scenario 3a)

Finally, just a reminder that Git repositories intended for use as remotes must be *bare* to prevent warnings and possible corruption. They are folders, and by convention, named with a `.git` extension. A bare repo is simply a repo without a working copy, so no changes can be made within that repo, they can only be pushed to it. For more on remotes and bare repos see [instalment 113](./pbs113).

## Scenario 1 — Cloning a Repo with Submodules (New Developer Joins App 1 Team)

Your first introduction to submodules will likely be cloning an existing repository that makes use of them, maybe in work, or maybe from some open source project. Without a basic introduction to submodules, this can be a very frustrating experience! Why? Because at first glance, it will appear the code in the repository is broken! But don't worry, just a few simple Git commands will get things running smoothly for you.

In our imagined scenario we are a developer who has just joined the team working on App 1, so we want to clone it to our computer. If you'd like to play along, please change into the `pc-app1Dev` folder.

In the real world, the URL for the repository we wish to clone which happens to use submodules will most likely be a genuinely remote repository that we connect to over SSH or HTTPS. But in our example we'll use a simple relative file path as the URL, specifically, we'll use `../remote-repos/pbscorp-app1.git`.

We can clone the repo as normal with the command (remember to make sure you are in the `pc-app1Dev` folder):

```sh
git clone ../remote-repos/pbscorp-app1.git
```

This command will appear to clone the repository without issue, and at first glance, all seems well. When you look inside the repo you've just cloned, you'll see a file named `index.html`, and a folder named `brand`. But, if you open `index.html` in your favourite browser you might notice that the app looks like an un-styled Bootstrap 5 app, and if you open the developer console you'll see an error to the effect that `brand/style.css` could not be found. This is our first clue that our submodule has not been initialised.

Before we resolve our issue, let's explore this repo a little more so we can learn how to tell if we have a clone with uninitialised submodules. Start by changing into the newly cloned repo with the command:

```sh
cd pbscorp-app1
```

We might imagine running `git status` to see the state of the repo would show us we have a problem, but it will not, it simply outputs:

```text
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

While this wasn't illuminating, there are two ways we can tell our newly cloned repo uses submodules. First, at a simple file system level, any repo that uses submodules will contain a file named `.gitmodules`. If you view the contents of this file you'll see that it contains the mappings between the folder names and the URLs for all the submodules that have been added to the outer repo. In our repo we can see by running the command:

```sh
cat .gitmodules
```

In our case, this outputs the details for just one submodule:

```text
[submodule "brand"]
	path = brand
	url = ../../remote-repos/pbscorp-brand.git
```

We can see that there is a submodule, and we can see the remote URL it should be cloned from, and the local folder it should be cloned into. To learn which remote commit our currently checked-out branch of the outer repo specifies for the submodule, issue the command:

```sh
git submodule status
```

In our case, this shows:

```text
-4e4c1243d73d16db9c331f88eab907cc8a4b61eb brand
```
 
This tells us two things:

1. That the `brand` folder is a submodule, (because the `git submodule status` command only lists submodules)
2. The ID of the remote commit that should be checked out in the submodules's local folder.

OK, so now that we know we have a submodule, how do we get the `brand` folder populated?

The first step is to tell Git to integrate the submodules specified in `.gitmodules` into its database in the `.git` folder. Use the command:

```sh
git submodule ini
```

This will show Git registering one submodule, and resolving the URL to a full path. For me, the output was:

```text
Submodule 'brand' (/Users/bart/Documents/Temp/From GitHub/programming-by-stealth/instalmentResources/pbs173/pc-app1Dev/../remote-repos/pbscorp-brand) registered for path 'brand'
```

Note that you only need to initialise submodules in two circumstances:

1. When you clone the module initially
2. When you pull a change that adds a new submodule to the outer repo

You might imagine initialising the submodule would clone it into the `brand` folder, but alas, no, the folder is still empty. To actually check out the correct commit from the submodule's remote repo into the folder you need to run the command:

```sh
git submodule update
```

This will check the currently checked out commit in each submodule against the outer branch's current saved state for the submodule, and perform any needed checkouts.

When working with truly remote repos this will just work, but as explained earlier, for security reasons, this command will fail with our local directories. We need to explicitly tell Git we are OK with file path URLs for our submodules by adding the configuration option described above, so for us, the command becomes:

```sh
git -c protocol.file.allow=always submodule update
```

Now you should see the submodule being cloned and the appropriate commit checked out into the `brand` folder. For me the output was:

```text
Cloning into '/Users/bart/Documents/Temp/From GitHub/programming-by-stealth/instalmentResources/pbs173/pc-app1Dev/pbscorp-app1/brand'...
done.
Submodule path 'brand': checked out '4e4c1243d73d16db9c331f88eab907cc8a4b61eb'
```

Note the ID of the checked out commit matches the output from `git submodule status` command we ran earlier.

Reload `index.html` in your browser and you should see the app adopt its corporate branding (and the console error will be gone).

## Scenario 2 — Adding a Submodule to a Repo (Starting App 2)

We're now going to pretend to be a different developer, one who's responsible for starting App 2. The PBS Corp sysadmins have done their  bit and created an empty git repository named `pbscorp-app2` on our simulated Git server (`remote-repos/pbscorp-app2.git`), so it's waiting there to be coned and filled  with code!

To play along, start by changing into the folder representing this developer's PC — `pc-app2Dev`.

From that folder, start by cloning the (empty) remote repo for App 2:

```sh
git clone ../remote-repos/pbscorp-app2.git
```

Change directory into the newly cloned local copy of the repo:

```sh
cd pbscorp-app2
```

Create an `index.html` with the initial code for the app from the  file `pbscorp-app2-index-1.html` in the instalment resources ZIP:

```sh
cp ../../pbscorp-app2-index-1.html ./index.html
```

Commit this initial version and push it to the *'remote'* repo on the pretend corporate Git server:

```sh
git add index.html
git commit -m "Feat: initial implementation"
git push
```

If you open `index.html` in your browser you'll see that we now have a working silly little web app counting down to Christmas. Apart from the baseline Boostrap 5 styles, it's completely un-styled, so it's missing the PBS Corp brand. Let's remedy that by adding it as a submodule!

Our company brand is available in the Git repo `pbscorp-brand`, and we'd like to include it in our repo in a folder simply named `brand`.

The git command to add a submodule is `git submodule add`, and it requires at least one argument — the URL for the remote repo. By default the base name of the remote repostitory (the last part of the URL with the `.git` extension removed) is used as the folder name, but you can override that with an optional second argument. That means the basic form of the command is:

```sh
git submodule add REMOTE_REPO_URL [LOCAL_FOLDER_PATH]
```

Before we do anything, note that there is no file in our repo named `.gitmodules`, and the `git submodule` command returns nothing:

```sh
cat .gitsubmodules
# cat: .gitsubmodules: No such file or directory

git submodule
# returns no output at all
```

OK, let's now add the brand to our repo as a submodule.

For our purposeses the URL to our *'remote'* repo is `../../remote-repos/pbscorp-brand.git`, so the default folder name within our repo would be `pbscorp-brand`. Since we want the repo cloned into in a folder named `brand` instead, we'll need to supply the optional second argument:

```sh
git submodule add ../../remote-repos/pbscorp-brand.git brand
```

This will fail purely because we are using a file path as a URL without explicitly telling Git that we're OK with that, so, let's add the Git configuration variable to enable file paths and try again:

```sh
git -c protocol.file.allow=always submodule add ../../remote-repos/pbscorp-brand.git brand
```

You'll see that this clones the remote repo into the brand folder. I'd like to draw your attention to a few things:

1. There is now a file named `.gitmodules` in the root of the repo, and it maps our remote URL to the folder `brand`: 

   ```sh
   cat .gitmodules 
   # [submodule "brand"]
   #         path = brand
   #         url = ../../remote-repos/pbscorp-brand.git
   ```

2. The `git submodule` command now lists one submodule:

   ```sh
   git submodule
   # 4e4c1243d73d16db9c331f88eab907cc8a4b61eb brand (heads/main)
   ```

   Note that it shows the ID of the curreltly checked out commit, then the name of the folder, then the remote branch checked out.

3. The submodule has been cloned, so the stylesheet is there:

   ```sh
   ls brand
   # style.css
   ```

By adding a submodule, we have made a change to the outer `pbscorp-app2` repo, but we have not committed it yet. Before we do any more, let's get the state of our repo with `git status`:

```text
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   .gitmodules
        new file:   brand
```

I'd like to draw your attention to three things:

1. The changes were automatially staged, we did not need to use `git add` to stage them.
2. The `.gitmodules` file is versioned in Git just like the `.gitignore` file is.
3. The entire submodule is presented as a single *'file'* with the folder's name.

We can now enable the corporate brand by editing `index.html` to include the stylesheet `brand/style.css`. The line to add is simply:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./brand/style.css">
```

But you'll find the full updated file in the instalment zip as `pbscorp-app2-index-2.html`, and you can copy it over your current file with:

```sh
cp ../../pbscorp-app2-index-2.html ./index.html
```

Now, when we open `index.html` in our browser we see the corporate brand has been applied.

If we do another `git status` can can now see that we have three changes waiting to be committed:

```text
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   .gitmodules
        new file:   brand

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   index.html
```

So, let's commit and push these changes:

```sh
git commit -am 'Feat: incporpoate the corporate brand using a submodule'
git push
```

## Scenario 3 — Pulling Submodule Changes (Updating the Brand)

Next, let's look at how we can pull changes into a Git submodule by walking through a brand update. We'll start the process by acting as the brand designer, then we'll change hats and become the developer of app 1, and finally, we'll change hats again to become the developer of app 2.

### Scenario 3a — The Brand Designer Updates the Brand

To play the part of the brand designer, change into the `pc-brandDesigner` folder. In here you'll find a freshly checked-out copy of the `pbscorp-brand` repository, so change into that folder (`cd pbscorp-brand`).

Note that from our point of view as the brand developer we are working on a regular Git repository. The fact that other repositories will link to this repository as a submodule makes no difference to how we interact with our copy of the repository. Verify that the repository is clean with a quick `git status`.

We want to make a change to the brand so that alternate level headings are in different colours. At the moment, all six HTML header tags render in dark blue, we'd like to keep doing that for `<h1>`, `<h3>` & `<h5>`, but to start rendering `<h2>`, `<h4>` & `<h6>` in dark green.

The updated style sheet is saved in the base of the installment ZIP as `pbscorp-brand-style-1.css`, you can copy it over the current style with the command:

```sh
cp ../../pbscorp-brand-style-1.css ./style.css
```

Verify that the change has indeed been made with another `git status`, it should show that there is one file changed:

```text
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   style.css

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

We can now commit and push our change:

```sh
git commit -am 'Feat: alternate heading colours'
git push
```

### Scenario 3b — The App 1 Developer Incorporates the Updated Brand

To play the part of the app 1 developer, chance into the `pc-app1Dev` folder. In this folder, we'll find the copy of the app we checked out in scenario 1, with its submodule for the brand initiated. Change into that repository (`cd pbscorp-app1`).

The first question you might have would be, how can we, as the developer of app 1,  tell that there is a change available for us to pull on the brand submodule?

You might assume a regular `git status` would show the possible changes, but it will not.  It simply outputs:

```text
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

This is a true reflection of the status of our copy of the `pbscorp-app1` repo, but it is completely ignoring the remote repos linked into our repo as submodules.

To instruct Git to recursively fetch all possible changes, both for our repo and for all submodules, use the command:

 ```sh
 git fetch --recurse-submodules
 ```

In effect, this triggers a `git fetch` within each submodule, and at least lets us quickly see if any of the remote repos our submodules are linked to have changed in any way. In our case we can see that the `brand` submodule has remote changes we can choose to pull:

```text
Fetching submodule brand
From /Users/bart/Documents/Temp/From GitHub/programming-by-stealth/instalmentResources/pbs173/pc-app1Dev/../remote-repos/pbscorp-brand
   4e4c124..9c84c1c  main       -> origin/main
```

Remember that `git fetch` only updates the local cache of a remote repo, it does not actually merge the changes into our repo.

To actually merge in the remote changes we need to use the `git submodule update --remote` command, but because we are using file URLs, and because this is a Git command the triggers other Git commands, we'll get an error if we don't also explicitly enable file URLs for all commands, so for us the command becomes:

```sh
git -c protocol.file.allow=always submodule update --remote
```

The output shows `brand` being updated to a new commit:

```text
Submodule path 'brand': checked out '9c84c1c83fd771642d432118808cbfb4571d8355'
```

If we now open App 1's `index.html` in our browser we'll see that the headings are no longer all blue, so we have successfully updated our copy of the brand from the remote repo.

We have now updated our `brand` submodule to a new commit, but we have not commited change in the parent repo (`pbscorp-app1`). We can see that this is the case by running a `git status`:

```text
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   brand (new commits)

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

We need to commit the fact that we updated the submodule, and push:

```sh
git commit -am "Feat: updated brand"
git push
```

Something to notice is that Git treats an entire submodule as a single item for versioning, it tells us that `brand` has been modified, not that specific files with the submodule have been modified.

### Scenario 3c — The App 2 Developer Incorporates the Updated Brand

We could repeat the same steps as we did for app 1, but there is actually a whole other way of interacting with Git submodules — we can treat them like regular Git repos!

In scenario 3b we interacted with the submodules from the parent repo, but if we change into the submodule, all `git` commands now see the submodule as just a plain old Git module, so you can interact with it just like you're used to. Let's give that a go by changing into the `brand` folder in `pc-app2Dev/pbscorp-app2` .

If we run a `git status` we see we are in a normal repo:

```text
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Because we haven't fetched changes from the remote yet, we don't see that we are now behind the updated brand. To learn about the remote changes without incorprating them into our working directory run:

```sh
git fetch
```

If you watch the output of the fetch you'll notice a new commit on `origin/main`, but you don't have to catch that flying by, if you do another `git status` you'll see we are now behind:

```text
On branch main
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

To incorporate the change we can just pull as normal:

```sh
git pull
```

Note that, like we always can, we can just do a `git pull` because it does an implicit featch first anyway.

We have now incporporated the changes from the remote brand repo into the `brand` folder. If we change back up the parent repo with a simple `cd ..` we can see that the parent repo has noticed the change of commit on the submoule by running a `git status`:

```text
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   brand (new commits)

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

We can now commit the brand update just like we did in scenario 3b:

```sh
git commit -am "Feat: updated brand"
git push
```

## A Note on Git GUIs — Most Show Submodules

We've learned that if you're working from the command line, you will know the repo you're working on has submodules if it contains a file named `.gitmodules`. In `.gitmodules` you'll find information about the submodules.

But if you're working with a Git GUI - how would you know that if your repo has submodules? If you look closely you'll notice, perhaps in a left sidebar, that there's a folder called Submodules.  As an example, in Gitfox you'll see the word submodules and upon hovering you'll get a chevron to show the name of any submodules with a nice little leaf icon next to it. 

![Gitfox GUI showing submodule in bottom left opened with Brand inside](./assets/pbs173/gitfox-gui-showing-submodule-brand.png)

In GitKraken, you'll also see submodules in the left sidebar with a chevron to open. GitKraken also puts a number next to it to tell you how many submodules you'll find inside.

## Final Thoughts

We've arrived at a natural break point for our exploration of Git submodules, but there is more to come in the next instalment. To this point, changes have flowed purely one way — with each app developer only consuming changes to the brand via a submodule. No changes have been contributed in the other direction. Pushing changes upstream from a submodule back to the remote repository it's linked to will be where we start the next instalment. Then, we'll move on to the last concept we'll tackle in this basic exploration of submodules — dealing with branches.
