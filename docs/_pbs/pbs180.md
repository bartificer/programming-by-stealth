In [the previous instalment](./pbs179), we learned the basics of how the Liquid templating language works within Jekyll. Because of our existing knowledge, we demonstrated how Liquid can be used within Markdown files in Jekyll sites, and while that is useful, it's not actually Liquid's most common use within Jekyll. So, what is the most common use for Liquid objects and tags in a Jekyll site? The definition of a Jekyll site's theme, and that's going to be the focus of this instalment.

## What's the Problem to be Solved?

The Markdown files that contain a Jekyll site's contents only contain the contents. They don't contain any of the other things you expect to see on a web page, like site-related branding, navigation bars, or footers. The obvious question is, how do those kinds of things get added? The answer is that the content in your files gets wrapped by pre-defined *layouts* (to use the correct Jekyll jargon), which are HTML files containing Liquid objects and tags. 

## Understanding Jekyll Theming

Jekyll theming is a rather loosely defined concept. There is no folder called `_theme` where the entire theme is contained. Instead, the HTML that gets wrapped around the Markdown is determined by two things:

1. The *layouts* the site defines
2. The assets referenced in the layouts
3. The reusable snippets referenced in layouts

Note that we won't be covering reusable snippets in this instalment; that will be the focus of our next instalment, so we'll park those for now.

By assets, we mean the images, style sheets, and JavaScript files referenced in the HTML in the layouts. These assets are treated like regular files by Jekyll, so they don't have an enforced location. However, there is a well-established convention of collecting the assets together into a top-level folder named `assets`, and that's a convention we'll be following in this series. **TO DO** — refer back to other earlier instalment where we discussed assets.

When it comes to the layouts themselves, they are a new concept to us, and I like to think of them as being like Russian nesting dolls. The result of converting your Markdown to HTML is the smallest doll, and that doll gets wrapped with one or more layouts to build the final HTML web page saved to the output folder.

Note my use of the word *wrap* — this is the word the Jekyll documentation uses, and it's the right way to think about how Jekyll sites get themed. Unlike assets, this is a very rigid rule.

## How Jekyll Layouts Work

Firstly, there is always a default layout, and if nothing tells Jekyll to use a different layout, then your page's content will get wrapped by that default layout.

So where does the default layout come from? Jekyll looks for a file named `default.html`, and it tries the following locations, in the following order until it finds one:

1.  `_layouts/default.html` in your input folder
2. `_layouts/default.html` in the theme specified in the site configuration, if there is one
3. `_layouts/default.html` own the default theme **BART - "own" the default theme? maybe "in" the default theme?**

For now, we will be working entirely within our current site. **We'll define all our layouts**, including our default layout, **in the `_layouts` folder** in our input folder (`docs` in our example site). 

Layout files are just plain old HTML pages containing Liquid objects and liquid tags.

Since layouts are designed to wrap content, they use the Jekyll-specific Liquid variable `content` to insert the content they are wrapping. In other words, at the point in your layout that you want the HTML version of your Markdown to appear, you add the Liquid Object `{% raw %}{{ content }}{% endraw %}`.

The simplest layout would simply be:

{% raw - %}
```html
<html>
  <body>
    {{ content}}
  </body>
</html>
```
{%- endraw %}


### Specifying Layouts

Layouts are always specified with base-name of HTML file that defines them, e.g. the layout `front_page` will always be defined by the file `front_page.html`. Jekyll decides on which `front_page.html` file to use based on the same rules described above for the default layout, that is to say:

1. The site's own `_layouts` folder (what we will be doing for now)
2. The site's theme, if one is specified (we are not specifying one at the moment)
3. The default theme

There is no limit to how many layouts you can create, and each page can be rendered by any layout. Jekyll chooses the layout file to go looking for by checking for the following metadata elements in the following order:

1. A front matter entry named `layout`
2. A taxonomy-level default layout (we'll be ignoring this feature for now since we're only using the basic *Pages* taxonomy at the moment)
3. The default layout (`default.html`)

As a practical example, if we assume we have created a special layout for the home page and saved it as `_layouts/front_page.html`, then we would specify its use by expanding the front matter in our `index.md` file to specify our layout like so:

```yaml
---
title: Home
layout: front_page
---
```



### Nesting Layouts

To avoid confusion as to how this works, I suggest avoiding thinking of layouts as inheriting from each other, and instead think of nested layouts — yes, back to our Russian Nesting Dolls metaphor.

The inner-most doll is the HTML generated by the Markdown conversion, and that HTML will always be wrapped by a layout, either the default, or one specified in the front matter or the site's configuration. **Every layout has the option to use its front matter to specify that the output it creates should be wrapped in another layout**.

**BART - the next paragraph was one loooong sentence that was hard to follow so I broke it up as best as I could understand, but I may very well have misinterpreted it.**

Let's continue our hypothetical example from above. Imagine that we want our `front_page` layout specified in `index.md` to add a little content around the result of converting `index.md` to HTML. But we want to add that content before wrapping all that with the default layout. We would add the following front matter to the top of `_layouts/front_page.html`:

```yaml
---
layout: default
---
```

This would give us three proverbial nested dolls — the Markdown converted to HTML as the inner doll, the extra HTML wrapped around that by the `front_page` layout as the middle doll, and the HTML wrapped around all that by the default theme as the final outer doll.

**BART: I feel like I need a diagram; this is pretty confusing. Is this close?**

* `_layouts/default.html`
  * contains `layout: front_page`
    * `front_page.html`
      * contains `layout: default` in front matter
        * Markdown → HTML

In other words, our page specifies a layout that specifies another layout.

### Liquid Variables within Layouts

**BART: I think some introductory language about shifting gears to talk about variables would be good. I don't see an earlier mention of the word in this instalment. This section starts with "firstly" but we're a third through which was confusing. My suggestion for smoothing the transition:**

As we covered in the previous installment, layouts will be created using Liquid variables, which are dictionaries. We have the `site` variable/dictionary, which is for information related to the site as a whole. Jekyll's standard `site` dictionary is available for use in all layouts.

Because layouts are always invoked to convert a specific Markdown file to HTML, there is always the concept of a *current page*, so layouts can access all the keys in the dictionary Jekyll builds to describe the current page. This dictionary is helpfully called `page`. This dictionary contains a combination of information collected by Jekyll and all the keys in the Markdown file's front matter. Some useful data in this dictionary includes `page.title` for the page's title, and `page.url` for the part of the page's final URL after the domain name. The [Jekyll documentation on variables](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/) gives a full description.

Note that when we move on to look at more advanced taxonomies, the `page` dictionary will become a lot more useful to us than it is now.

Liquid tags and objects within layout files have access to the Jekyll-provided variable `layout,` which is a dictionary containing just the keys defined in the layout file's front matter.

To summarize, the Liquid objects and tags within a layout file can use:

* `content` to access the content that should be wrapped.
* `layout` to access any front matter defined within the layout itself.
* `page` to access page-specific metadata including any front matter added to the top of the page.
* `site` to access the site-specific data, including all keys added to the site's `config_yml` file.

## Some Important Liquid Filters when Designing Layouts

We met some Liquid filters in [the previous instalment](./pbs179), and we did include links to the full list of available filters, but I want to highlight a few that are particularly important or useful when building layouts with the `relative_url` filter.

|               Filter                | Description                                                  |
| :---------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `relative_url` (important reminder) | For a Jekyll site to work reliably both locally and when published to GitHub Pages, all internal URLs used to link to assets and site pages within layouts **need** to be passed through this filter! |
|     `uri_escape` & `cgi_escape`     | This pair of related filters is vital for safely handling URL encoding of data coming from Liquid variables. `uri_escape` is used to sanitise entire URLs, while `cgi_escape` is used to sanitise individual values in query strings. |
|            `markdownify`            | This tag is used to convert Markdown from a Liquid variable to HTML. The naming choice is potentially confusing, so to be clear, this filter converts **Markdown → HTML**! |
|       `normalize_whitespace`        | This filter cleans up strings with strange spacing issues, possibly caused by concatenating lots of variables together, or from poorly formatted front matter. All consecutive white space characters get collapsed into a single space. |
|             `smartify`              | When writing in Markdown, we generally use vanilla single and double quotes (non-directional ones), but there are separate glyphs in modern fonts for explicitly directional single and double quotes. Most content management systems automatically convert vanilla quotes in the content to so-called *smart quotes* on published pages. Jekyll will do this for the content in your Markdown files, but if you need this filter to apply the same functionality to strings coming from variables. |
|     `array_to_sentence_string`      | When rendering lists in your layouts, you may want to convert them into human-friendly sentences by adding commas between all but the last two pairs, and a different word or symbol between those last two. That's what this filter does, defaulting to *and*, with support for an optional argument to specify another word like *or*. |
|               `sort`                | This filter sorts a list alphabetically, or, if it's a list of dictionaries, by the key or keys specified with the named argument `:sort`. |
|              `sample`               | Something many content management systems do is highlight a randomly chosen piece of content somewhere, usually the front page. The `sample` filter takes a list as its input and outputs a single randomly chosen element. The filter can support returning more than one random item by adding a number as the optional argument. |
|              `inspect`              | This filter is useful for debugging, it converts any variable into a string so you can see what it contains. |

These are all Jekyll-specific Liquid filters, and you'll find their [full documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/filters/) (though it is a little terse) on the Jekyll site.

## Worked Example 1 —  Explaining our Current Bootstrap 5 Default Layout

From the start of our exploration of Jekyll, we've been using a very basic layout that loads Bootstrap 5, wraps our content in some appropriate HTML 5 tags, and inserts a header at the top of all pages. Up until this point, I've asked you to indulge me by simply accepting the content of `_layouts/default.html` as *magic sauce* on the promise that we would explain how it actually works later. Well, now we've learned enough to do just that, so let's get stuck in 🙂

If you'd like to play along, our starting point will be our demo site as we left it at the end of the previous instalment. You can [download a snapshot of the site at the appropriate commit here](https://github.com/bartificer/pbs-jekyll-demoSite/releases/tag/pbs180-startingPoint), or you can clone the repo and checkout the commit with the tag `pbs180-startingPoint`.

Because I wanted to start with as simple a demo site as possible, the site only has one layout at the moment — the default layout — which is defined in `_layouts/default.html` in our site's input folder, i.e. `docs`. Here's the content of that file as it stands at this point in the series:

{% raw -%}
```html 
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <title>{{ page.title }} | {{ site.title }}</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ '/assets/css/style.css' | relative_url }}">
</head>
<body>
<main class="container pt-3">
    {{ content }}
</main>
<script src="{{ '/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js' | relative_url }}"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
{%- endraw %}

For the most part, you'll recognise this as the standard HTML 5 page structure as recommended in the Bootstrap documentation, but it contains five Liquid objects.

The first two set the window/tab title for pages to the page's title as read from the `page.title` Liquid variable followed by a pipe, followed by the site's title as read from the `site.title` variable.

Note that  `page.title` is loaded from the front matter in the current Markdown file. If you look at the front matter in, say, `about.md` you'll see it says:

```yaml
---
title: About
---
```

The rule is that all page metadata provided by Jekyll and all front matter defined at the top of the page are made available via the `page` dictionary, so `title` in a page's front matter become `page.title` in Liquid.

Similarly, the values defined in `_config.yml` are merged with the site-level metadata provided by Jekyll into the `site` variable, so the following line from the top of `_config.yml` defines `site.title`:

```yaml
title: PBS Jekyll Demo Site
```

The third Liquid object inserts the Bootstrap 5 style sheet converted to standard CSS from Bootstrap's SASS source code by Jekyll. I want to remind you of two things; firstly, the source file for `/assets/css/style.css` is `/assets/css/style.scss`. When Jekyll converts the file from SASS to CSS, it also changes the file extension. And secondly, this is a relative URL, so we must filter it with the `relative_url` filter.

The third Liquid object inserts the special variable `content` — this variable holds the page's content converted from Markdown to HTML by Jekyll. This is where we inject the content to be wrapped by the layout.

Finally, we use another Liquid object with the `relative_url` filter to include the Bootstrap 5 JavaScript.

For now, that's all there is to our very simple starter layout, and indeed, our very simple started theme as a whole!  **← BART - not sure how to fix this sentence.** Our entire demo site theme currently consists of the Bootstrap SASS source code, the bundled Bootstrap JavaScript code, and a default layout consisting of just 15 lines of HTML code with just five Liquid objects making use of just one three Liquid variables and one Liquid filter. **← BART: Is it one or three? I think 3?** There's not even a single Liquid tag used yet!

## Worked Example 2 — Creating a Custom Layout for our Front Page

To demonstrate how layouts are nested, let's update our demo site to make the front page a little different from the others. We still want the front page to be Bootstrap 5, etc., so we don't want to lose anything provided by the default layout. But we want to move some of our hard-coded content from the Markdown into a custom layout. The only thing that should remain in the Markdown is the actual content for the front page. Specifically, we want our custom layout to handle two things:

1. The logo at the top should become a theme asset and be added automatically by the layout
2. The list of pages should become a site map and also be added automatically by the layout

We want to wrap our home page content between two things provided by the custom layout, which we want wrapped by the default layout.

As a first step, let's clean `index.md` and remove everything but the content, so you'll just be left with a very simple file:

```markdown
---
title: Home
---
This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)-powered website designed to be tested locally and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

It serves as the basis for the examples in the [Programming by Stealth](https://pbs.bartificer.net) mini-series on using Jekyll as a Content Management System compatible with GitHub Pages.
```

Next, let's follow our convention and move the now theme-related *jumbotron* image from the `illustrations` folder to the `assets` folder. We want it to become `/docs/assets/siteIllustration.png` within the repo as a whole.

If we build the site locally at this point, we'll now see that our front page has lost its banner and the list of pages, and only contains the content now left in `index.md`.

The next step is to create our custom layout in the `_layouts` folder. We'll call this layout `front_page`, so the file to create is `_layouts/front_page.html`, and it should have the following content:

{% raw %}
```html
---
layout: default
---
<img src="{{ 'assets/siteIllustration.png' | relative_url }}" alt="An Illustration showing the PBS logo over the GitHub and Jekyll Logos with a plus between them" class="img-fluid">

{{ content}}

<h2>Site Map</h2>
<ul>
    {%- assign list_pages = site.html_pages | where_exp: "item", "item.title != 'Home'" %}
    {%- for p in list_pages %}
    <li><a href="{{ p.url | relative_url }}">{{ p.title }}</a></li>
    {%- else %}
    <li class="text-muted">No pages yet</li>
    {%- endfor %}
</ul>
```
{% endraw %}

You'll find a copy of this file in the resources ZIP as `layouts_front_page.html` (remember to rename it!).

Let's have a look at the contents of this file to understand what it does.

Firstly, notice that we specify the fact that we want this layout to get wrapped by the default layout by specifying the default layout in the front matter:

```yaml
---
layout: default
---
```

Next, note that we are working in HTML here, not Markdown!

When the image is inserted we use the `relative_url` filter to sanitise a string literal rather than the content of a variable (`'assets/siteIllustration.png' | relative_url`).

We use the special `content` variable to specify the insertion point for the converted Markdown.

Next, we use the same Liquid looping construct that was originally in `index.md`, but now we're looping over an HTML unordered list rather than a Markdown list, and we're adding HTML `<a>` tags rather than Markdown links.

Again, note the all-important use of the `relative_url` filter!

With that our layout is ready to be applied to our home page. We do that by adding a `layout` definition to the front matter in `index.md`:

```yaml
---
title: Home
layout: front_page
---
```

The entire `index.md` file is now just 7 lines! Also, notice it's now pure Markdown and YAML, with no weird Liquid syntax cluttering our content anymore.

```markdown
---
title: Home
layout: front_page
---
This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)-powered website designed to be tested locally and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

It serves as the basis for the examples in the [Programming by Stealth](https://pbs.bartificer.net) mini-series on using Jekyll as a Content Management System compatible with GitHub Pages.
```

For your convenience you'll find this version of the file in the instalment ZIP.

If you rebuild your site you'll see we've succeeded in our task 🎉

## A challenge — Add a Navigation Bar to the Default Theme

We've now learned enough Jekyll to be able to resume our tradition of ending each instalment with a challenge. In this case, the intention is to both to put what we've learned so far about Jekyll into practice, but also to blow the cobwebs off our Bootstrap 5 skills if they've gone unused for a while.

Using the code for our sample site as it stands at the end of the worked example above as your starting point, update the default layout to add a Bootstrap 5 nav bar to the top of the page that lists all the pages on your site.

When it's correctly implemented the nav bar should appear on all pages, both regular ones which use the default layout like `/about`, and the front page which now uses a dedicated layout.

_**Hint:** you'll need a Liquid loop similar to the one used to print the list of pages in the layout for the front page._

For your convenience, you can quickly access the starting point for this challenge by [downloading a snapshot of the demo site at the appropriate commit here](https://github.com/bartificer/pbs-jekyll-demoSite/releases/tag/pbs180-challenge-startingPoint), or you can clone the repo and checkout the commit with the tag `pbs180-challenge-startingPoint`.

## Final Thoughts

Learning how to nest layouts is very powerful, and simply understanding that principle opens many doors, enabling sufficient theming for basic sites. However, to really get the most out of Jekyll, we need to learn a related concept — reusable HTML snippets that can be added to multiple themes. We can even put them into our content to facilitate features that Markdown can't handle natively, like the use of `<figure>` tags to add images with captions. We'll dedicate the next instalment to learning about the Jekyll *includes,* which are implemented using the `include` Liquid tag, often with the help of another powerful Liquid tag,  `capture`.
