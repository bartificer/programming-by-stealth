## Mini-Series House Keeping — The Demo Site for Remaining Examples

In the remainder of this series we'll be learning more about Jekyll as a Content Management System (CMS) by building a demo site that contains all the features we'll be discussing. It's going to be one site that we effectively started in the previous instalment, and each instalment will use the final state of the site at end of the previous as the starting point for all examples.

To make this as painless as possible, and to facilitate people dipping in and out at any point in the series, the site will be versioned on GitHub with tagged releases marking each instalment's starting point. This gives listeners three options for playing along:

1. Download or fork the original repo once, to start this instalment's examples, and keep that same copy current all the way through, presumably just testing the code locally.
2. Start fresh each time by downloading the compressed version of the full codebase from the appropriately named release each time, and again, presumably just testing locally.
3. Fork the repo on GitHub and pull the appropriate changes from the original (`upstream`) repo as needed, and test both locally and on GitHub Pages.

You'll find the repository on GitHub as [bartificer/pbs-jekyll-demoSite](https://github.com/bartificer/pbs-jekyll-demoSite), and the tagged release for this instalment's starting point is [pbs178-startingPoint](https://github.com/bartificer/pbs-jekyll-demoSite/releases/tag/pbs178-startingPoint).

## Cloning an Existing Site on a New Device

Before you begin, check you have the needed Ruby environment in place on the new device by opening a fresh terminal and verifying the following:

1. That you are running the correct version of Ruby with the command `ruby --version`, that should match the version described in [instalment 177](./pbs177) (As of March 2025 that is `ruby 3.3.4`).
2. That you have Bundler installed by running the command `bundle --version`

If your environment is not prepared, follow the instruction in the section '*Preparing to Run Jekyll Locally*' in [instalment 177](./pbs177).

Once your environment is ready, clone the existing site to your device and open a terminal in that folder. Change into the folder that contains the site (probably `docs` if the site is intended for publication on GitHub Pages, so probably `cd docs`).

At the very least our current directory should now have a `Gemfile`, and it should probably also have an `_config.yml`, and an `index.md`.

All you need to do to get up and running now is to instruction Bundler to configure Ruby in your newly cloned folder based on the content of the `Gemfile` with the command:

```sh
bundler install
```

That's it! You should now be able to run your site locally with the usual `bundle exec jekyll serve` command.

## Jekyll's Rules for Ignoring, Copying, or Transforming Files

Fundamentally, Jekyll takes a folder of input files, processes them in some way, and creates a new folder with output files, the assembled website. For each file in the input it can either:

1. Be **excluded** from the output in one of two ways:
   1. **Ignored** — it does not appear in the output, and it does not have any effect on the presentation or content of the generated site
   2. **Ingested** — it does not appear in the output directly, but it does have some kind of effect on the presentation or content of the generated site
2. Be **copied**, un-changed from the input folder to the generated website
3. Be **processed** so as to transform it in some way as Jekyll copies it from the input folder to the generated website

Jekyll has clearly defined rules for how it handles files in the input folder, and understanding them is vital to avoid being perpetually confused by Jekyll's behaviour.
