## Cloning an Existing Site on a New Device

Before you begin, check you have the needed Ruby environment in place on the new device by opening a fresh terminal and verifying the following:

1. That you are running the correct version of Ruby with the command `ruby --version`, that should match the version described in [instalment 177](./pbs177) (As of March 2025 that is `ruby 3.4.1`).
2. That you have Bundler installed by running the command `bundle --version`

If your environment is not prepared, follow the instruction in the section '*Preparing to Run Jekyll Locally*' in [instalment 177](./pbs177).

Once your environment is ready, clone the existing site to your device and open a terminal in that folder.
