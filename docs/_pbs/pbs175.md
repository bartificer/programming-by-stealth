This instalment is the start of a new series-within-a-series focusing on the technology that powers this website, and, that hosts the new JavaScript version of [XKPasswd](https://www.xkpasswd.net) — GitHub Pages.

GitHub Pages provides a very interesting free web hosting option that inherently provides a full version history to easily recover from any kind of whoopsie. It's also surprisingly versatile and powerful. On one end of the spectrum you can use it to simply host a folder of HTML, CSS & JavaScript files exactly as they are, and on the other end of the spectrum you can build a full content management system with all the taxonomies and content organisation features you would expect from on a typical blog or corporate site. The mechanism GitHub Pages uses to achieve this is completely different to that used by the most popular content management system in the world, [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org), but is fundamentally the same as that used by the fashionable new up-and-comer, [Hugo](https://kinsta.com/blog/hugo-static-site/).

In this first instalment we'll set the scene, explaining the difference between dynamic content management systems like Wordpress, and static site generators like Github Pages and Hugo. We'll also give a big-picture overview of how GitHub Pages works, and hence, the technologies we'll be exploring over the coming months.

## What Problems do Content Management Systems Solve?

Before we get lost in the weeds of the two different architectures for content management systems, let's step back for a moment and describe the problem all these systems set out to solve in their own distinct ways.

1. **Separation of content creation from content presentation**
   1. Separation at the **task** level — even if one person is running the entire site, they can easily focus on either designing it, or, creating content, they never have to wear two proverbial *hats* at once
   2. Separation at the **storage** level — regardless of how the data is stored, the content is segregated from the site's design
   3. It should be possible to change the content without needing to edit the design, and to change the design without editing the content
2. Content needs to be **organised** into sensible taxonomies, and new content should automatically appear in the correct locations within the site based on the taxonomies the creator applies. Examples of taxonomies include:
   1. Nested Page hierarchies
   2. Time-based sequences of posts or articles (blogs)
   3. Categories
   4. Tags
3. Support an **editorial process** — the details will differ from organisation to organisation
   1. Content management systems need to facilitate an organisation's desired process for creation, review, and publishing of content
   2. For personal sites or sites for small organisations the needs here may be very basic — perhaps just a mechanism for marking content as being in draft

## Two World Views — Dynamic & Static

All content management systems combine content with a theme of some kind to produce the HTML, CSS & JavaScript readers view in their browsers. The two big questions are:

1. When does the content get rendered to HTML, CSS & JavaScript?
2. Where is the content stored?

In theory these two questions are not linked, but in reality they almost always are, so we get answers to both questions with just two categories of CMS.

### Read-Time Rendering — Dynamic CMSes

More traditional CMSes like Wordpress render pages on-demand, the moment the reader would like to read them. This is done using a server-side language like PHP, and the content is stored in a relational database. 

When you visit a Wordpress site like Podfeet.com your browser sends a request to Allison's web server which then runs PHP code which reaches back to a web server Allison runs and builds the web page you requested, and returns it to your browser.

As you browse Allison's site from page to page, the same process happens again and again.

There is a significant amount of infrastructure needed to power a website like this:

1. A Linux or Windows server with a web server like Apache or NGINX and PHP
2. A Database server
3. The Wordpress code

The server has quite a bit of work to do on each page view, so a small number of users can make a lot of work for this infrastructure. Spikes in traffic can easily cause excessive loads on the server, so for even vaguely popular sites an additional layer of infrastructure is needed — a caching server. For this cache to be effective it needs to be tightly integrated with Wordpress so it can know when a particular post has been edited, or a new comment added, so it can invalidate it's cached copy of that page and ask the server for a fresh rendering next time a user asks for it.

Running a dynamic website involves continued bills and at least some amount of maintenance work to keep everything patched and secure.

But you do of course get some advantages:

1. Content publishes instantly
2. Content can be published at a high rate
3. User interaction like comments is natively supported
4. Authors and editors can use a web interface to manage the content

### Publication-Time Rendering — Static Site Generators

### How do you Choose?

Neither approach is objectively better or worse, but each approach has advantages and disadvantages in every real-world scenario. The question is not *"which approach is best?"*, but *"which approach is best for me/us?"*.



If you're running a popular new site like the stalwart of tech news Ars Technica, you could realistically be publishing new articles multiple times an hour, and multiple user comments per second. A dynamic CMS
