This instalment is the start of a new series-within-a-series focusing on the technology that powers this website, and, that hosts the new JavaScript version of [XKPasswd](https://www.xkpasswd.net) — GitHub Pages.

GitHub Pages provides a very interesting free web hosting option that inherently provides a full version history to easily recover from any kind of whoopsie. It's also surprisingly versatile and powerful. On one end of the spectrum you can use it to simply host a folder of HTML, CSS & JavaScript files exactly as they are, and on the other end of the spectrum you can build a full content management system with all the taxonomies and content organisation features you would expect from on a typical blog or corporate site. The mechanism GitHub Pages uses to achieve this is completely different to that used by the most popular content management system in the world, [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org), but is fundamentally the same as that used by the fashionable new up-and-comer [Hugo](https://kinsta.com/blog/hugo-static-site/).

In this first instalment we'll set the scene, explaining the difference between dataset-driven content management systems like Wordpress, and static site generators like Github Pages and Hugo, and describing the big-picture architecture of GitHub Pages. The aim is to understand what the various components are and how they're connected to each other. This will then prepare the way for us to dive into the various parts in detail in future instalments.

## What Problems do Content Management Systems Solve?

Before we get lost in the weeds of the two different architectures for content management systems, let's step back for a moment and describe the problem all these systems set out to solve in the very distinct ways.

1. **Separation of content creation from content presentation**
   1. Separation at the **task** level — even if one person is running the entire site, they can easily focus on either designing it, or, creating content, they never have to wear two proverbial *hats* at once
   2. Separation at the **storage** level — regardless of where files and/or databases are used to store information, the content is segregated from the site's design
   3. It should be possible to change the content without needing to edit the design, and to change the design without editing the content
2. Content needs to be **organised** into sensible taxonomies, and new content should automatically appear in the correct locations within the site based on the taxonomies the creator applies. Examples of taxonomies include:
   1. Nested Page hierarchies
   2. Time-based sequences
   3. Categories
   4. Tags
3. Support an **editorial process** — the details will differ from organisation to organisation
   1. Content management systems need to facilitate an organisation's desired process for creation, review, and publishing
   2. For personal sites or sites for small organisations the needs here may be very basic, perhaps as simple as a toggle for between a *draft* and *published* mode, or perhaps a configurable publication date.

## Two World Views — Dynamic & Static

When it comes to choosing a content management system, they can all be sorted into two very distinct buckets — read-time rendering, or publication-time rendering. Content management systems that generate their views on-demand for each reader as they navigate the website are usually referred to as **dynamic**, and systems that re-build the website once for all readers each time the content changes are usually called **static site generators**.

Neither approach is objectively better or worse, but each approach has advantages and disadvantages in every real-world scenario. The question is not *"which approach is best?"*, but *"which approach is best for me/us?"*.

To get your head around how this works, let\'s describe how the most popular dynamic content management system in the world and GitHub Pages work from three points of view — someone writing content, someone reading the content, and someone managing the site.

### A Dynamic Example — Wordpress

#### Reading Wordpress Content

#### Creating Wordpress Content

Before you can contribute to a Wordpress-powered site you need an account on that site. An admins sets one up for you and gives you the authentication details and the login URL. You log in, and you get presented with a button for editing existing pages and/or posts, and creating new ones. Depending on the permissions your administrator gave you your work may be constrained to certain document types or categories, and you may be restricted to certain action. For example, you might be able to edit existing articles but not create new ones, and you may or may not have the power to control the publication state of pages and/or posts.
