This instalment is the start of a new series-within-a-series focusing on the technology that powers this website, and, that hosts the new JavaScript version of [XKPasswd](https://www.xkpasswd.net) — GitHub Pages.

GitHub Pages provides a very interesting free web hosting option that inherently provides a full version history to easily recover from any kind of whoopsie. It's also surprisingly versatile and powerful. On one end of the spectrum you can use it to simply host a folder of HTML, CSS & JavaScript files exactly as they are, and on the other end of the spectrum you can build a full content management system with all the taxonomies and content organisation features you would expect from on a typical blog or corporate site. The mechanism GitHub Pages uses to achieve this is completely different to that used by the most popular content management system in the world, [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org), but is fundamentally the same as that used by the fashionable new up-and-comer [Hugo](https://kinsta.com/blog/hugo-static-site/).

In this first instalment we'll set the scene, explaining the difference between dataset-driven content management systems like Wordpress, and static site generators like Github Pages and Hugo, and describing the big-picture architecture of GitHub Pages. The aim is to understand what the various components are and how they're connected to each other. This will then prepare the way for us to dive into the various parts in detail in future instalments.

## What Problems do Content Management Systems Solve?

Before we get lost in the weeds of the two different architectures for content management systems, let's step back for a moment and describe the problem all these systems set out to solve in the very distinct ways.

1. Free content creators from the need to understand web technologies — writers should be able to focus 100% on writing, and never need to know that their writings will ultimately be presented to users on a web page using HTML & CSS.
2. Content needs to be organised into sensible taxonomies, and new content should automatically appear in the correct locations within the site based on the taxonomies applied. Examples of taxonomies include:
   1. Nested Page hierarchies
   2. Time-based sequences
   3. Categories
   4. Tags
3. Support an editorial process. The details will differ from organisation to organisation, but content management systems need to facilitate an organisation's desired process for creation, review, and publishing. For personal sites or sites for small organisations this may not be needed.
