In this very special 50th instalment I share my screen with Allison and we build up a simple web app together. We start with the scariest thing of all, a blank screen, and take it from there.

The web app we build up together is an object visualiser. Our simple web app consists of a text area into which we can enter JavaScript code to define an object, a `<div>` into which we will render a representation of the object, and a button to trigger the rendering.

Just about everything we use in this little exercise is revision, with one exception — we meet JavaScript’s `eval()` function for the first time. The `eval()` function takes as an argument a string, and executes it as JavaScript code. For more details, [see the MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval).
