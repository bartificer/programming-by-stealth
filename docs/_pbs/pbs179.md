## What's the Problem to be Solved?

When building sites with a static site generator like Jekyll you need a mechanism for injecting information into the otherwise static source files using some kind of place-holders. That could be site-wide information like a list of all pages that exist, page-specific information like the date it was published, theme-specific information, or some other form of data being added to the site. In short, static site generators need some kind of templating engine, and rather than inventing their own, the Jekyll developers chose to use an existing open source templating engine, [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).

## Some Background on Liquid

Liquid was developed as part of the very first release of the [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) e-commerce platform, and was released as open source immediately. It remains in use today as the templating engine used to customise customer stores on the Shopify platform.

There are in effect three variants of Liquid —
there is the open source core which the other variants build on, and which anyone can use in any generic context. And then there are dedicated variants for Liquid's two mistnprominent usages — a variant for Shopify, and another for Jekyll. These both extend the core by adding additional application-specific features.

I mention this detail because it can be really helpful when interpreting search results!

There are the official documentation links for the two flavours that are relevant for our use:

* **The Core Liquid Docs:** [shopify.github.io/…](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) (we can use all the features described here for the specific version of Liquid included in our specific install of Jekyll)
* **The Jekyll Extensions to Liquid:** [jekyllrb.com/…](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/)

Finally, when you use Jekyll with GitHub Pages (like we are), there is one final source of extended liquid functionality to be aware of — the `github-metadata` Jekyll plugin included automatically as a dependency of the `github-pages` gem. The official (very limited) [documentation is available here](https://jekyll.github.io/github-metadata/).

## Liquid's Architecture

If you zoom out to the conceptual level, Liquid really is just an alternative to other templating engines like Mustach which we used while building client-side Javascript web apps. 

Liquid takes as input template strings which contain placeholders, and a collection of data, and produces output strings the appropriate data substituted for the placeholders. 

Where things differ is in the proverbial *plumbing*. We invoked Mistach by calling a two-argument function that returned the output strings — we passed that function a template string with placeholders, and a data structure, and it returned a string.

With Jekyll it's our source files that act as the template strings, and Jekyll provides the data as part of the site rendering process. The results of the substitutions appear in the files that make up the generated site.

So: `input files with Liquid tags + Jekyll variables → output files`

There are of some subtleties, but the big-picture rule is that HTML and Markdown files in the input folder always get processed with Liquid, and so do other text-based files in the input folder with front matter, but there are exceptions and you can add explicit exclusions too.

## Jekyll's Liquid Variables

Under the hood the data Jekyll presents to Liquid is actually stored in Ruby variables, but it's presented to the world as generic data compatible with both JSON and YAML. In other words, the data available for use in Liquid templates consists of arbitrarily nested combinations of simple values, lists, and dictionaries.

The core version of Liquid provides no built-in data structures, and the Shopify and Jekyll variants provide completely different sets of data.

All the data Jekyll makes available within Liquid templates is organised into a well named and well documented collection of dictionaries. The documentation refers to these dictionaries are *variables*. Some of these variables are available everywhere Jekyll processes Liquid tags, but some are only available in specific contexts. They are all so sensibly named that you're unlikely to try use the wrong variable in the wrong context.

You'll find a [full list of the variables in the Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/), but some of the most important ones are:

* `site` for information related to the site as a whole.
  * When using Jekyll with GitHub Pages there is also `site.github` with additional GitHub-specific site-wide data related to the repository hosting the site.
* `page` for information related to the current page.
* `layout` for the information related to the theme layout(s) in use for building the current page.

We'll learn more about these variables later in the series as we start to use them.
