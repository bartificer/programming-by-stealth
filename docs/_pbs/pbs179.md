## What's the Problem to be Solved?

When building sites with a static site generator like Jekyll you need a mechanism for injecting information into the otherwise static source files using some kind of place-holders. That could be site-wide information like a list of all pages that exist, page-specific information like the date it was published, theme-specific information, or some other form of data being added to the site. In short, static site generators need some kind of templating engine, and rather than inventing their own, the Jekyll developers chose to use an existing open source templating engine, [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).

## Some Background on Liquid

Liquid was developed as part of the very first release of the [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) e-commerce platform, and was released as open source immediately. It remains in use today as the templating engine used to customise customer stores on the Shopify platform.

There are in effect three variants of Liquid —
there is the open source core which the other variants build on, and which anyone can use in any generic context. And then there are dedicated variants for Liquid's two mistnprominent usages — a variant for Shopify, and another for Jekyll. These both extend the core by adding additional application-specific features.

I mention this detail because it can be really helpful when interpreting search results!

There are the official documentation links for the two flavours that are relevant for our use:

* **The Core Liquid Docs:** [shopify.github.io/…](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) (we can use all the features described here for the specific version of Liquid included in our specific install of Jekyll)
* **The Jekyll Extensions to Liquid:** [jekyllrb.com/…](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/)

## Liquid's Architecture

If you zoom out to the conceptual level, Liquid really is just an alternative to other templating engines like Mustach which we used while building client-side Javascript web apps. 

Liquid takes as input template strings which contain placeholders, and a collection of data, and produces output strings the appropriate data substituted for the placeholders. 

Where things differ is in the proverbial *plumbing*. We invoked Mistach by calling a two-argument function that returned the output strings — we passed that function a template string with placeholders, and a data structure, and it returned a string.

With Jekyll it's our source files that act as the template strings, and Jekyll provides the data as part of the site rendering process. The results of the substitutions appear in the files that make up the generated site.

So: `input files with Liquid tags + Jekyll data structures → output files`

There are of some subtleties, but the big-picture rule is that HTML and Markdown files in the input folder always get processes by liquid, and so do other input files with front matter that are not somehow excluded.
