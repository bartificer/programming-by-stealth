## What's the Problem to be Solved?

When building sites with a static site generator like Jekyll you need a mechanism for injecting information into the otherwise static source files using some kind of place-holders. That could be site-wide information like a list of all pages that exist, page-specific information like the date it was published, theme-specific information, or some other form of data being added to the site. In short, static site generators need some kind of templating engine, and rather than inventing their own, the Jekyll developers chose to use an existing open source templating engine, [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).

## Some Background on Liquid

Liquid was developed as part of the very first release of the [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) e-commerce platform, and was released as open source immediately. It remains in use today as the templating engine used to customise customer stores on the Shopify platform.
