We ended [the previous instalment](./pbs178) with a teaser ‚Äî we'd just hard-coded a list of our site pages on the home page, and realised that surely can't be the right thing to do!

In this instalment, we learn to do this simple task the right way ‚Äî using Jekyll's support for the Liquid templating engine.

## What's the Problem to be Solved?

When building sites with a static site generator like Jekyll, you need a mechanism for injecting information into the otherwise static source files using some kind of placeholders. That could be site-wide information like a list of all pages that exist, page-specific information like the date it was published, theme-specific information, or some other form of data being added to the site. In short, static site generators need some kind of templating engine, and rather than inventing their own, the Jekyll developers chose to use an existing open source templating engine, [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).

## Introducing Liquid Templates

Liquid was developed as part of the very first release of the [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) e-commerce platform way back in 2006 and has always been shared with the world as an open source project. To this day, Shopify customers still use Liquid to customise their store fronts on the platform!

Something that can get a little confusing is that there are three official variants of Liquid. Thankfully, the relationship between them is very clearly defined, but it does mean that when you search for Liquid, you need to be conscious of the fact that the code you find may not work in the variant you're using!

The most fundamental variant is the core open source project maintained by Shopify. This contains the language's core features and its most generic set of standard utilities. The other two variants both extend this common core by adding their own domain-specific utilities. The original variant is the one for use on Shopify's platform, and the other one is the one maintained by Jekyll. **BART - it says there are 3 variants, but then you say the other "one is the one", do you mean "ones are the ones"?**

For us, that means there are two relevant variants ‚Äî the core and the Jekyll variant. Here are the links to the official documentation for both:

* **The Core Liquid Docs:** [shopify.github.io/‚Ä¶](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) (we can use all of the features described here for the specific version of Liquid included in our specific install of Jekyll) **BART - specific in specific - confusing. also hope there's more explanation of the difference coming**
* **The Jekyll Extensions to Liquid:** [jekyllrb.com/‚Ä¶](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/)

Something else to bear in mind is that all flavours of Liquid have evolved significantly over the years, so the documentation for both our variants contain annotations to tell you in what version they were introduced. Jekyll is sometimes behind the core, and GitHub Pages uses an older version of Jekyll, so this is especially important for us. Remember that we can use the `bundle` command within our local copy of our site to check the versions we're running of both, for example, in May 2025, this is what I see in my copy of the demo site for this series:

```text
$ bundle show | egrep 'jekyll |liquid'
  * jekyll (3.10.0)
  * liquid (4.0.4)
```

*__Note__ the space after `jekyll`, this is important because if you leave it out the regular expression matches ever sub-package that makes up Jekyll as well as the master package which is the only one we want to see!)*

Finally, when you use Jekyll with GitHub Pages (like we are), there is one final source of extended Liquid functionality to be aware of. The `github-metadata` Jekyll plugin is included automatically as a dependency of the `github-pages` gem. The official (very limited) documentation for that is [available here](https://jekyll.github.io/github-metadata/). It's a very simple plugin, though, its only role is to allow you to insert Git URLs, etc., into your site dynamically. That way, you can add links that will always point to the correct Issues URL, etc., even in forked copies.

## Liquid's Architecture

If you zoom out to the conceptual level, Liquid really is just a typical templating engine like [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io) (the one we used for building client-side JavaScript web apps [earlier in this series](./pbs73)). 

Liquid takes as input template strings that contain placeholders and a collection of data. It produces as output new strings with the placeholders replaced with the appropriate data. 

Where things differ from how we used Mustache is in the proverbial *plumbing*. We invoked Mustache by calling a two-argument function to generate our output strings. We passed that function two inputs: a template string with placeholders, and a data structure, and the function returned the rendered string with the placeholders replaced with the appropriate data.

With Jekyll, it's our source files that act as the template strings, and Jekyll builds the data structures needed as part of the site rendering process. So we don't explicitly call Liquid ‚Äî instead, Jekyll uses Liquid to do its work, and we include the Liquid placeholders in our input files. The results of the substitutions then appear in the generated website.

In other words: `input files with Liquid tags + Jekyll variables ‚Üí output website`

There are, of course, some subtleties, but the big-picture rule is that HTML and Markdown files in the input folder always get processed with Liquid, and so do other text-based files in the input folder with front matter present. Jekyll's documentation describes the exceptions to this general rule and how you can add explicit exclusions of your own using your site's `_config.yml` file. We're not going to confuse things in this introduction by diving into these edge cases right now.

## Jekyll's Liquid Variables

Under the hood, the data Jekyll presents to Liquid is actually stored in Ruby variables, but it's presented to the world as generic data compatible with both JSON and YAML. In other words, the data available for use in Liquid templates consists of arbitrarily nested combinations of simple values, lists, and dictionaries.

The core version of Liquid provides no built-in data structures, while the Shopify and Jekyll variants both provide **domain-specific sets of data**, which are, of course, completely different in the two variants. This can lead to **confusion when reading search results!**

All the data Jekyll makes available within Liquid templates is organised into a well-named and well-documented collection of dictionaries. The documentation refers to these dictionaries as *variables*. Some of these variables are available in all our input files, but some are only available in specific contexts. They are all so sensibly named that you're unlikely to try to use the wrong variable in the wrong context.

You'll find a [full list of the variables in the Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/), but some of the most important ones are:

* `site` for information related to the site as a whole.
  * When using Jekyll with GitHub Pages (like we are), there's also `site.github` with additional GitHub-specific site-wide data related to the repository versioning of the site.
* `page` for information related to the current page.
* `layout` for the information related to the theme layout(s) in use for building the current page.

We'll learn more about these variables later as we start to use them.

## The Basic Liquid Syntax ‚Äî Objects, Tags, and Filters

Before we dive in, just a reminder that in this series, we always use the technically correct jargon as per the relevant official documentation. We do this even when that jargon is, shall we say, *suboptimal*. While this can be a little irritating, bear in mind that not doing so would be disempowering, because it would hinder independent research. That would of course fly in the face of our primary goal with this series ‚Äî to empower you to scratch your own digital itches!

With that said, let's look at the three main components of the Liquid syntax ‚Äî *objects*, *tags*, and *filters*.

### Liquid Objects

Were the Shopify developers to have asked for my opinion, I would definitely not have advised them to name their data placeholders *objects*, but, alas, they didn't care about the opinions of a neophyte sysadmin when they made that choice way back in 2006 üòâ

Anyway, the Liquid documentation refers to **data placeholders** as *Liquid **objects***. Thankfully, while the name is confusing, the syntax is very straightforward! Simply surround the reference to some data with doubled curly braces (yes, just like Mustache)!

Liquid also uses the same basic JavaScript-like syntax for referencing nested variables ‚Äî periods (`.`) to descend into dictionaries, and square braces (`[]`) to access list elements via their zero-based indexes. So, to insert the site description from the Jekyll `site` variable, you would use {% raw %}`{{ site.description }}`{% endraw %}, and to get the title of the site's first page, you would use {% raw %}`{{ site.pages[0].title }}`{% endraw %}.

### Liquid Tags

If you want to use Liquid for anything more than simply inserting some data, you need to use *Liquid tags*. The syntax for these is also very simple ‚Äî wrap the tag name and the appropriate additional information for the specific tag  {% raw %}`{%`{% endraw %} and {% raw %}`%}`{% endraw %}.

Each tag has its own syntax, but to give you a flavour, you can implement conditions like so:

```markdown
{% raw %}This site {% if site.title %}is titled '{{ site.title }}'{% else %}has no title üôÅ{% endif %}{% endraw %}
```

And basic iteration like so:

```markdown
{% raw %}# Site Pages:
{% for p in site.pages %}
- [{{ p.title }}]({{ p.url }})
{% else %}
*This site has no pages üôÅ*
{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
```

When using Jekyll, the tags available for use are a superset of those provided by the core Liquid variant and those provided by the Jekyll variant.

* The core Liquid tags are broken into four categories in the official documentation:
  * Control Flow (conditionals) ‚Äî [shopify.github.io/‚Ä¶](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/control-flow/)
  * Iteration (loops) ‚Äî [shopify.github.io/‚Ä¶](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/iteration/)
  * Template (comments, disabling rendering, and nesting templates) ‚Äî [shopify.github.io/‚Ä¶](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/template/)
  * Variables ‚Äî [shopify.github.io/‚Ä¶](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/variable/)
* The tags provided by Jekyll are listed in the Jekyll docs ‚Äî [jekyllrb.com/‚Ä¶](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/)

I usually find the appropriate tag to solve my specific problem in the core variant, and in general, the examples in the official docs are all I need to successfully use the tags.

### Liquid Filters

*Liquid filters* are used to transform data when it's being rendered using Liquid objects (double curly-braced placeholders). Filters take values as inputs and produce new values as outputs. You direct values into filters using the pipe symbol (`|`), and you can chain multiple filters together by adding more pipes.

Simple filters don't require arguments, so you invoke them by just placing their name after the pipe symbol, e.g. `{% raw %}{{ site.pages | size }}{% endraw %}` will output the number of pages in the site (`pages` is a list).

More complex filters expect one or more arguments, and those have to have a `:` placed after their name, followed by a comma-delimited list of arguments. A very useful example of a filter that takes an argument is `default`. You use this filter to provide a default value for a variable that may or may not be defined. For example, not all pages have IDs, so you could use the following example to show a page's ID or a human-friendly message:

```markdown
{% raw %}**Page ID:** {{ page.id | default: "this page has no ID" }}{% endraw %}
```
Note that with a few exceptions, **filters can't be used inside tags**. 

One exception is the `assign` tag, which is used to assign a value to a variable (more on that in a moment). 

Another interesting exception is the `size` filter, which returns the number of items in a list or the number of characters in a string. This filter can be invoked using the dot notation, which is usually reserved for descending into dictionaries. For example, we can use the size of the `site.pages` list in the condition part of an `if` tag, like so:

```markdown
{% raw -%}
{% if site.pages.size > 10 %}
This is a big site!
{% else %}
This is a small site.
{% endif %}
{%- endraw %}
```

Like with tags, the filters available to us when working within Jekyll are a superset of those provided by the core Liquid variant, and those provided by the Jekyll variant.

* Descriptions of each of the core filters are available via the sidebar of the official docs ‚Äî [shopify.github.io/‚Ä¶](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/)
* Descriptions of the filters provided by Jekyll can be found in the Jekyll docs ‚Äî [jekyllrb.com/‚Ä¶](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/filters/)

### Saving the Output from a Filter

As mentioned previously, you can't loop over a filtered array (list) in one step because you can't use a filter within a regular tag. The one exception is the special tag for assigning values to variables, the perfectly named `assign` tag. This means that we can loop over the results generated by a filter, but we need to do it in two steps ‚Äî first, save the filter's output to a new variable, then loop over that new variable.

For example, To loop over a list of all static Javascript files in a site we can use the `assign` tag to create a new variable named `js_files`. We do this by filtering the list of all static files in the site (`site.static_files`) down to just those with a file extension (available via the `extname` key) with the value `js` using the `where` filter. 

Note that the `where` filter takes two arguments ‚Äî the name of the key whose value should be checked, and a required value for that key. Only items in the input list where the value of the given key matches the given value will be returned by the filter.

```markdown
{% raw -%}
# Site Java Script Files

{%- assign js_files = site.static_files | where: "extname", ".js" %}
{%- for file in js_files %}
- `{{ file.path }}`
{%- endfor %}
{%- endraw %}
```

If you add this section to `index.md` in our demo site, you'll see it only has one JavaScript file ATM, `/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js`.

## Liquid Data Types

As mentioned previously, Liquid variables only support the data types supported by JSON and YAML, so it really is just the basics:

| Type | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| Booleans | The two Boolean literals are simply `true` & `false`. |
| Numbers | Numbers are simply entered as regular numbers without any kind of quotations, e.g. `42` & `3.1417`. |
| Strings | Strings can be quoted with single or double quotes, e.g. `'A string'` & `"Another String"`. |
| Lists (*Arrays*) | The Docs refer to lists as *arrays*. Indexes are zero-based and specified inside square braces. Negative indexes are supported, with `-1` being the index of the last element in an array. E.g. `myArray[0]`, `myArray[42]` & `myArray[-1]`. |
| Dictionaries | These are not listed as a separate data type in the official docs. They appear to be considered simply nested variable names by the developers. Each level of nesting is separated with a period symbol (`.`), e.g. `myDictionary.someKey`. |

Liquid also supports some **speical literals**, specifically `nil` to represent the absence of any value at all (what Javascript represents with `null`), and `empty` to represent a list or string which exists but has no content.

### A Note on Truthiness

In Liquid, just about everything evaluates to `true` when coerced to a Boolean ‚Äî **the only things that coerce to `false` are `false` itself and `nil`**. Everything else, including the number zero, empty strings, empty lists (arrays), and empty dictionaries, all coerce to `true`. This can really catch developers who usually code in more traditional languages like JavaScript by surprise!

## Operators in Liquid (For Comparisons Only!)

This might come as a surprise, but Liquid does not support any arithmetic operators! The only operators Liquid does support are comparison operators!

That doesn't mean arithmetic and string manipulations are impossible; you just use filters rather than operators.

Anyway, these are the operators you can use when making comparisons in Liquid: 

| Operator | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| `==` | Is equal to, e.g. `myString == "some string"` or `myNumber == 42`. |
| `!=` | Is not equal to, e.g. `myString != "some string"` or `myNumber != 42.` |
| `<` | Is less than, e.g. `myNumber < 42`. |
| `>` | Is greater than, e.g. `myNumber > 42`. |
| `<=` | Is less than or equal to, e.g. `myNumber <= 42`. |
| `>=` | Is greater than or equal to, e.g. `myNumber >= 42`. |
| `and` | Logical *and*, e.g. `myNumber > 0 and myNumber <= 12.` |
| `or` | Logical *or*, e.g. `myString == "ok" or myString == "yes"`. |
| `contains` | Substring containment check, e.g. `myString contains "something"`. Only works on strings and lists (arrays) of strings. |

For complex comparisons, round brackets (`()`) can be used to group sub-expressions.

## How Liquid Handles White Space

To stop Liquid objects and tags from affecting the layout of the rendered text in unwanted ways, you can specify that all white space should be stripped before or after any object or tag by adding a minus symbol (`-`) directly inside any opening or closing delimiter.

If we assume the value of the variable `desert` is `WAFFLES`, then the following input text:

```text
I like {{ desert }} very much üôÇ
I like {{- desert }} very much üôÇ
I like {{ desert -}} very much üôÇ
I like {{- desert -}} very much üôÇ
```
Is rendered as:

```text
I like WAFFLES very much üôÇ
I likeWAFFLES very much üôÇ
I like WAFFLESvery much üôÇ
I likeWAFFLESvery much üôÇ
```

## Worked Example ‚Äî Making Our List of Pages Dynamic

As promised, our example real-world task is to replace the hard-coded list of pages on our demo site's home page with a dynamically generated list that will update itself automatically as new pages are created.

To do this, we need to make use of the `site` variable, which is a dictionary. That dictionary contains a list named `pages,` which contains dictionaries representing all the files that will appear in the output site that have been transformed by Jekyll (rather than just being passed through unchanged). You might expect this to be exactly what we need, but it actually contains too much information. Why? Because our style sheet is built by Jekyll from the original SASS code, so it appears in the `site.pages` list too. Don't worry, though, there is a more tightly constrained list named `site.html_pages,` which contains only the items that get rendered to HTML by Jekyll. This is the list we'll use.

Even this list actually has one more superfluous item ‚Äî the home page itself! After all, we don't need a link to the home page on the list of pages rendered on the home page! 

This need to filter out the home page provides the perfect opportunity to use one of the most powerful additional filters provided by Jekyll ‚Äî `where_exp`. The built-in `where` filter can only filter by checking a specific key against a specific value, but the `where_exp` filter lets us filter by any valid Liquid condition.

If you'd like to play along, our starting point will be our demo site as we left it at the end of the previous instalment. You can [download a snapshot of the site at the appropriate commit here](https://github.com/bartificer/pbs-jekyll-demoSite/releases/tag/pbs179-startingPoint), or you can clone the repo and checkout the commit with the tag `pbs179-startingPoint`.

Once you have your starting point, you actually only need to make one change to achieve our goal! Simply replace the following lines in `index.md`

```markdown
## Site Pages

* [About](about)
* [Links](links)
```

With these lines:

```markdown
{% raw -%}
## Site Pages

{%- assign list_pages = site.html_pages | where_exp: "item", "item.title != 'Home'" %}
{%- for p in list_pages %}
- [{{ p.title }}]({{ p.url | relative_url }})
{%- else %}
- *No pages yet*
{%- endfor %}
{% endraw -%}
```

(For convenience you'll find an updated version of the complete `index.md` file in the instalment ZIP.)

That's not many lines of code, but there is a lot going on there, so let's focus in on some key points.

Firstly, note the use of the white space control minus symbols to stop the generated markdown filling with blank lines.

Next, I used an `assign` tag to store a filtered copy of dictionaries representing the input files that will become HTML pages in the rendered site. The full list of those dictionaries is available as `site.html_pages`) and we pass these to the `where_exp` filter to remove the dictionary representing the home page.

Let's have a closer look at this filter's syntax. Like the more basic `where` filter from the core variant, the `where_exp` filter also takes two arguments. But, but instead of specifying a key name and an exact required value, you provide a name of your choosing, and string containing a Liquid condition.

Think of the first argument as being like the `i` in a traditional C/Javascript `for` loop ‚Äî we could use any name, but to make our code easier for us an others to read later, we stick to the commonly adopted convention of naming it `i`. In this case the convention is to use the name `item` as the first argument.

So, how does `where_exp` work? The input must be a list (an array). The filter applies the condition passed as the second argument to each item in the input list, using the name provided in the first argument. The output is a new list (array) containing only the items where the condition evaluated to `true`.

So, in our example, each dictionary representing a file in our site that will be rendered to HTML gets named `item`, and only those for which `item.title != 'Home'` evaluates to `true` appear in the outputted list. In other words, what comes out of the `where_exp` filter is a list of dictionaries representing all our markdown files except `index.md` which has the title *Home*. This list is then saved to a new variable named  `list_pages` by the `assign` tag. 

We now have a list of just the pages we want to appear in on our home page, so we use a `for` tag to loop over it. Within the `for` tag's body we use two Liquid objects (placeholders) to inject each page's title and URL into (from the `title` and `url` keys in the dictionaries representing each file) into the markdown syntax for a bulleted list item containing a link.

Actually, there is one more nuance that needs to be pointed out ‚Äî we don't actually insert the raw URL, we pass it through another filter ‚Äî `relative_url`. This is another filter provided by the Jekyll variant rather than the core variant, and it's an **extremely important** one! 

When building a site with Jekyll, the internal links need to work regardless of the base URL the generated site will be published at. You can't simply assume the file part of the final URL will start at the domain's root level (`/`). That assumption does hold true when you're testing locally because the base URL is `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`, but it's not true when you publish the site to the internet with GitHub Pages (unless you use a custom domain) ‚Äî the default base URL for a GitHub Pages site is `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPONAME/`, e.g. `https://bartificer.github.io/pbs-jekyll-demoSite/`.

What this all means is that **if you don't filter all relative URLs through `relative_url` your site** will work just fine when testing locally but it **will break when published to GitHub Pages**!

## Final Thoughts

Believe it or not, we've actually introduced  the basics of **almost** every important Liquid feature. Almost, but one very substantial feature remains to be explored ‚Äî how Jekyll uses nested Liquid templates to define the *layouts* which define a site's theme. That's going to be our focus next time!
