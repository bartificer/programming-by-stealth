## Resources

- Docs explaining how to enable Jekyll on GitHub Page — [docs.github.com/…](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) (need a repo configured to use Pages first)
- Docs for testing GitHub pages locally — [docs.github.com/…](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) (can't do until basic site up and running)
