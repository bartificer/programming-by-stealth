# PBS 54 of X ‚Äî More Bootstrap Utilities

In the previous instalment we started our exploration of Bootstrap with a look at some of its commonly used utility CSS classes. We‚Äôll finish that off in this instalment by looking at some more utility CSS classes. That will finish out our initial look at the utilities. We‚Äôll then be ready to move on to the next major component of Bootstrap, the CSS libraries it provides for enhancing existing HTML content.

## PBS 53 Challenge Solution

At the end of [the previous instalment](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs53), I set the challenge of applying what we learned during the instalment to the recipe page you created for the previous challenge, and to add some extra HTML elements into your recipe that we‚Äôll need in future instalments. You‚Äôll find my sample solution in [this instalment‚Äôs ZIP file](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pbs54.zip) or [here on GitHub](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bbusschots/pbs-resources/instalmentZips/pbs54.zip) in the folder named `pbs53-challengeSolution`.

I chose to use the colour, margin, padding, and border utility classes to style my _Did You Know_ box:

```html
<aside class="m-5 border border-info rounded">
  <h2 class="bg-info text-light p-2">Did you Know?</h2>
  <p class="text-muted p-2">The Cucumber is a member of the nighshade family of plants, along with the tomato, the melon, and even the potato!</p>
</aside>
```

I also used the colour utilities to mark the entire description as secondary, the heading for the instructions as primary, and the important note on salting the cucumber as `text-danger`. I also used the alignment and font utilities for marking up the quotation from the great American chef Julia Child.

When it came to adding in the requested extra HTML elements, I chose to add the bulleted list as a list of required equipment, to quote the great Julia Child for my block quote, to convert my existing image into a full-blown figure, and to add a glossary as a definition list.

## Playground

Like last time I‚Äôve created an HTML document with some previously created elements and empty `class` attributes which you can use to play along with this instalment. I‚Äôm including the source below, but you‚Äôll also find it in [this instalment‚Äôs ZIP file](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pbs54.zip) or [here on GitHub](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bbusschots/pbs-resources/instalmentZips/pbs54.zip) as `pbs54a.html`, and in [this interactive Bootply playground](https://www.bootply.com/aNM7DS9MfB#).

## Display Utilities (Just the Basics)

Way back in [instalment 9](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs9), we learned about the `display` CSS property. We learned that each HTML tag defaults to being displayed as inline content, a block, an inline block, or one of a few special cases, and that we can use this property to override that default and make something that normally displays inline display as a block etc..

Bootstrap provides CSS utility classes for quickly and easily achieving the same things. The most common of these are shown below, but it‚Äôs not an exhaustive list:

*   `d-none` ‚Äî do not show the element.
*   `d-block` ‚Äî display the element as a block-level element.
*   `d-inline` ‚Äî display the element as an inline element.
*   `d-inline-block` ‚Äî display the element as an inline block element.

In the aside in our sandbox page, we can see that headings and paragraphs are displayed as block-level elements by default ‚Äî the heading is one block, and the paragraph is another block appearing after it within the flow of the page.

We can use the Bootstrap display CSS utility class `d-inline` to render both as inline elements so our aside becomes more compact:

```html
<aside class="text-muted bg-light border rounded p-2 m-3">
                  <h3 class="d-inline">Note:</h3>
                  <p class="d-inline">Kavanagh got his wish ‚Äî he is comemorated with a bench that has a statue of him setting on it next to the Royal Canal in Dublin city. Passers by can sit next to Kavanagh on his bench and ponder the view, perhaps with these lines running aroun in their heads.</p>
                </aside>
```

Notice the use of the background, text, and border utilities discussed in the previous instalment on the aside as a whole.

## Vertical Alignment Utilities

Once an item is displayed as inline block, its vertical alignment can be controlled. Bootstrap provides CSS utility classes to make this easier. They are named as you would probably expect them to be ‚Äî `align-baseline`, `align-top`, `align-middle`, `align-bottom`, `align-text-top`, & `align-text-bottom`.

## Position Utilities

Going even further back, we learned about the `position` CSS property in [instalment 8](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs8). By default HTML elements are positioned within the normal flow of the page, but we can use the `position` property to offset them relative to their normal position, or even remove them from the normal flow completely and position them absolutely within their container, or fix them to the visible part of the page, known as the _viewport_.

Again, Bootstrap provides us with CSS utility classes for controlling the positioning. We can do the basics as you might expect:

*   `position-static` ‚Äî position the element in the normal flow of the document (the default behaviour)
*   `position-relative` ‚Äî position the element relative to its regular place within the flow of the document (i.e. relative to where it would appear if its position was static)
*   `position-absolute` ‚Äî position the element absolutely within its container
*   `position-fixed` ‚Äî fix the element relative to the viewport

Bootstrap goes further though, and provides utilities for the two most common fixed use-cases:

*   `fixed-top` ‚Äî fix the element to the top of the viewport
*   `fixed-bottom` ‚Äî fix the element to the bottom of the viewport

Finally, Bootstrap also provides utilities for the new, and still experimental, sticky positioning feature. An element whose position is sticky is displayed differently depending on where the viewport is scrolled to. If the element‚Äôs normal position within the page is visible in the viewport then that‚Äôs where it will be show. If not, it will be positioned relative to the viewport. The way to think about it is that, if the element‚Äôs normal position within the page is visible, then it is positioned `relative`, otherwise it‚Äôs positioned `fixed`:

*   `position-sticky` ‚Äî set `position: sticky` on the element
*   `sticky-top` ‚Äî set the element to stick to the top of the viewport when its regular position is not visible

A very common place to see sticky positioning is on cookie notices. So let‚Äôs do that in our sandbox page by adding the class `sticky-top` (and some other classes we learned about in the previous instalment) to the cookie notice at the top of our sandbox page:

```html
<div class="sticky-top bg-danger text-white p-1 rounded m-1">
  If this page used cookies this notification would let you know that, but it doesn't, so it doesn't!
</div>
```

## Size Utilities

Bootstrap provides utilities for specifying widths and heights. These take the following form:

```
{dimension}-{value}

```

Where `{dimension}` can be one of:

*   `w` ‚Äî width
*   `h` ‚Äî height
*   `mw` ‚Äî max width
*   `mh` ‚Äî max height

And where `{value}` can be one of:

*   `25` ‚Äî 25%
*   `50` ‚Äî 50%
*   `75` ‚Äî 75%
*   `100` ‚Äî 100%
*   `auto` ‚Äî the CSS special value `auto`

As an example, we can combine the sizing class `w-75` with the auto-padding class we learned about last time (`m-auto`) and some border and padding utilities to make the poem in our sandbox page 75% of the width of the page and centred:

```html
<blockquote class="w-75 m-auto border rounded p-3">
...
</blockquote>
```

## Float Utilities

Now that we know how to control the width and height of elements, we‚Äôre ready to make use of Bootstrap‚Äôs utility CSS classes for floating elements.

As you might expect, Bootstrap provides the following three classes which do exactly what their names suggest ‚Äî `float-left`, `float-right`, and `float-none`.

Bootstrap goes a step further thought and provides a fix to a common problem ‚Äî floating elements punching through the bottom of their containing element when it doesn‚Äôt have as much content as the floating element. This can really mess up layouts. So there is a real need for a simple way to tell an element that contains floats that it should stretch to fully include the floating elements ‚Äî enter Bootstrap‚Äôs `clearfix` class. You apply this class to the element that contains the floats, not to the elements that are being floated.

As a practical example, let‚Äôs float the aside within the poem to the right by first making it 25% of the width with `w-25`, and then floating it with `float-right`. For completeness we should ensure the aside could never poke out the bottom of the poem by adding `clearfix` to the element that contains the float, i.e., to the `<blockquote>` tag:

```html
<blockquote class="clearfix w-75 m-auto border rounded p-3">
  <h2 class="">Lines Written on a Seat on the Grand Canal, Dublin</h2>

  <aside class="w-25 float-right text-muted bg-light border rounded p-2 m-3">
    <h3 class="d-inline">Note:</h3>
    <p class="d-inline">Kavanagh got his wish ...</p>
  </aside>

  <p class="">"Erected to the memory of ...</p>
</blockquote>
```

## Flexbox Utilities

Casting our minds back to [instalment 9](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs9) again, we learned how CSS 3 really improved positioning with the introduction of flex boxes.

As you may remember, the CSS for using flex boxes can get quite confusing, so you‚Äôll probably be happy to hear that Bootstrap has simplified things for you.

In pure CSS you need to specify that the containing element is a flex container. Then you need to explicitly mark each child element as a flex item. Bootstrap utilities simplify this greatly ‚Äî simply add the class `d-flex` to the element you want to use as a flex container, and all direct children will become flex items automatically.

Bootstrap also provides CSS utility classes for controlling the direction the flex boxes will stack in:

*   `flex-row` ‚Äî to stack flex items next to each other
*   `flex-column` ‚Äî to stack flex items on top of each other

Once you‚Äôve decided the direction you‚Äôre stacking your item in, the next thing you‚Äôll want to decide is what to do with the empty space between elements:

*   `justify-content-start` ‚Äî all the empty space comes after the flex items. In other words, the items are all bunched together at the start of the flex container
*   `justify-content-end` ‚Äî all the empty space comes before the flex items. In other words, the items are all bunched together at the end of the flex container
*   `justify-content-center` ‚Äî half of the empty space comes before the flex items, and half after. In other words, the items are all bunched together in the middle of the flex container.
*   `justify-content-between` ‚Äî the empty space is equally distributed in the gaps between the flex items. Note that the first and last items touch the edges of the flex container.
*   `justify-content-around` ‚Äî the empty space is equally distributed around the flex items. Note that the first and last items do not touch the edges of the flex container because a share of the empty space goes at the start and end of the container.

Bootstrap also lets us control how flex items should behave in the axis that‚Äôs opposite of their stacking direction, the so-called _cross axis_.

For simplicity, let‚Äôs think about this in terms of horizontally stacked flex items (the Bootstrap class `flex-row`). The flex container will have a height, either expressly set, or simply the height of the tallest flex item. Where should each of the flex items be positioned vertically within the row? That‚Äôs what these utilities control:

*   `align-items-start` ‚Äî all the flex items stick to the top of the row
*   `align-items-end` ‚Äî all the flex items stick to the bottom of the row
*   `align-items-center` ‚Äî all the flex items centre themselves vertically within the row
*   `align-items-stretch` ‚Äî all the flex items stretch to fill the full height of the row

Bootstrap also provides a very useful utility class for creating equal-width flex items that stretch to fully fill a flex container. To achieve this, add the class `flex-fill` **to each flex item**.

Bootstrap also provides utility classes for controlling the wrapping of flex items when they don‚Äôt fit into a single row/column of a flex container. `flex-nowrap` disables wrapping, meaning flex items that don‚Äôt fit will simply burst through the end of the flex container. `flex-wrap` enables wrapping, meaning items will wrap around onto a new row or column as appropriate.

To demonstrate flex boxes, let‚Äôs convert the navigation area at the bottom of our sandbox page into a nice flex box.

Firstly, we need to convert each list item into a regular block so it doesn‚Äôt have a bullet next to it. There is a better way to do this as we‚Äôll learn soon, but using only what we know so far, the way to do this is to add the classes `d-block` to each list item.

We‚Äôre now ready to convert the unordered list into a flex container by giving it the class `d-flex`. Next we want to specify that we‚Äôd like a horizontal flex box, so we add the class `flex-row` to the list as well. Finally we distribute the empty space evenly around the flex items by adding the class `justify-content-around`. At this stage we‚Äôre almost done, but the nav bar would look better if the emoji were centred relative to the rest of the text. This can be achieved by displaying the span that contains them as an inline block with a vertical alignment of middle. We do this by adding the classes `d-inline-block` and `align-middle` to the relevant spans.

Putting all that together we get the following code for the nav bar:

```html
<nav class="">
  <ul class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-around">
    <li class="d-block">
      <a class="" href="http://www.twitter.com/bbusschots"><span class="d-inline-block align-middle" style="font-size: 50pt">üê¶</span> <span class=>@bbusschots</span></a>
    </li>
    <li class="d-block">
      <a class="" href="http://www.bartb.ie/"><span class="d-inline-block align-middle" style="font-size: 50pt">üåê</span> <span class="">bartb.ie</span></a>
    </li>
    <li class="d-block">
      <a class="" href="http://flickr.com/photos/bbusschots/"><span class="d-inline-block align-middle" style="font-size: 50pt">üì∑</span> <span class="">bbusschots</span></a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

## Screen Reader Utilities

Bootstrap makes it easy to add elements into your page that are only visible to assistive technologies like screen readers.

To hide an element from everything but a screen reader, simply give it the class `sr-only`. For example:

```html
<p>The next paragraph is only visible to screen readers</p>
<p class="sr-only">Hello Screen Reader User!</p>
```

## Final Example

Putting all the examples above together we get the following final version of our sandbox page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />

    <!-- Include Bootstrap 4 CSS -->

This file is included in this instalment‚Äôs ZIP file as `pbs54b.html`.

## A Challenge

Using what we learned today, make the following changes to your recipe:

1.  Find something in your recipe that defaults to a block and render it as inline, or vice-versa.
2.  Make your recipe‚Äôs heading stick to the top of the page once you scroll by it.
3.  Adjust the width of your ingredients table, and float it left or right.
4.  If you don‚Äôt already have a list of the equipment needed, create one as an unordered list, and use emoji or glyphicons to add an icon to each one. Then, render that list as a horizontal row using a flex box.

## Final Thoughts

We‚Äôre done with Bootstrap utility CSS classes for now, though we will be revisiting some of them later when we learn more about Bootstrap page layouts. That means we‚Äôre ready to move on to the second of the four major aspects of Bootstrap ‚Äî content. In other words, using Bootstrap CSS classes to better render standard HTML elements like lists, tables, forms, etc. When we‚Äôre done with the content aspect, we‚Äôll move on to Bootstrap‚Äôs page layout aspect before finishing our tour of Bootstrap with a look at some custom components Bootstrap provides (modal dialogues, dismissible alerts, and much more).
