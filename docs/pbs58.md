# PBS 58 of X ‚Äî Bootstrap Breakpoints

We‚Äôve now been introduced to two and a half of the four aspects of the Bootstrap web API. We‚Äôve had our first look at the Bootstrap CSS utility classes. We‚Äôve also looked at many of the CSS classes Bootstrap provides for styling standard HTML elements (_content_ in Bootstrap jargon). Now we‚Äôre about half way through our look at Bootstrap‚Äôs layout CSS classes. So far in terms of layout we‚Äôve met the Bootstrap grid and learned about how it breaks your page into container that contain rows that contain columns, and how column widths are expressed as twelfths of the container width. In this instalment we‚Äôll take our first look at Bootstrap‚Äôs support for responsive design by looking at how the Bootstrap grid layouts can be altered depending on the viewport width.

There is more to Bootstrap‚Äôs support for responsive design than just the grid. In the next instalment we‚Äôll look back a little and discover that many of the bootstrap utilities and content classes also support responsive design. After that we‚Äôll be ready to move on to the fourth and final aspect of Bootstrap: its collection of non-standard but commonly needed HTML elements, or _components_ in Bootstrap jargon.

## PBS 57 Challenge Solution

The challenge set at the end of [the previous instalment](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs57) was very simple ‚Äî edit the recipe you‚Äôve been working on over the last few challenges to use the Bootstrap grid for layout. The challenge was to produce a layout that looks good on regular desktop and laptop screens.

I always say there is no single correct answer to these challenges, but that really couldn‚Äôt be more true here ‚Äî we‚Äôre all starting off with a different starting point, and we all have different opinions on how we want our recipe laid out. So we‚Äôre all going to produce wildly different final pages. I‚Äôm including my sample solution as an additional worked example more than anything else.

I chose to group my display heading and lead paragraph together into a single container, and to use the HTML5 semantic `<header>` tag to do so. I decided to place the two elements (the display header and the lead) into a single row, and to give the majority of the space to the display header, and just 3 atomic columns to the lead paragraph next to it.

I then chose to group the remainder of the page into a second container, and I used the HTML5 semantic `<main>` tag for that. For this container I decided to use multiple rows rather than a single one.

On the first row I included a 3-atomic-column wide sidebar for the ingredients and the aside about cucumbers, and left the remainder of the row for the instructions and the figure, which I chose to float.

Finally, I placed the equipment list and glossary next to each other on a final row as two equal-width columns.

One important subtlety I do want to draw your attention to is my sticky-top header. The only way to keep that working is to make the entire container sticky top. Doing it on a per-row level will not work because the Bootstrap classes `sticky-top` and `row` are not compatible with each other.

I‚Äôve included my full recipe in the `pbs57-challengeSolution` in folder [this instalment‚Äôs ZIP](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pbs58.zip) or [here on GitHub](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bbusschots/pbs-resources/instalmentZips/pbs58.zip).

However, the focus of this challenge was the overall structure, and that‚Äôs easier to see with most of the page content removed:

```html

## Bootstrap‚Äôs Break Points

To support responsive design, Bootstrap is built around five named viewport width ranges known as _breakpoints_.

The first range is named `xs`, for _extra small_, and it‚Äôs intended for phones in portrait orientation. This is the default breakpoint, and it actually covers all possible viewport widths, being defined as any viewport with a minimum width of zero! Because `xs` is the default, you won‚Äôt see its name used very often.

The second range is named `sm`, for _small_, and is intended for phones in landscape mode. It‚Äôs defined as all viewports with a minimum width of 576px.

The third range is named `md`, for _medium_, and is intended for tablets. It‚Äôs defined as all viewports with a minimum width of 768px.

The fourth range is named `lg`, for _large_, and is intended for laptops and desktops. It‚Äôs defined as all viewports with a minimum width of 992px.

Finally, there‚Äôs `xl`, for _extra large_, which is intended for large-screened desktops. It‚Äôs defined as all viewports with a minimum width of 1200px.

[![Bootstrap Breakpoints](../assets/pbs58/Screen-Shot-2018-07-14-at-15.50.50.png)](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-14-at-15.50.50.png)

The Bootstrap breakpoints with Screen Width on the X axis and Specificity on the Y.

What you‚Äôll notice is that the smaller breakpoints all encompass the larger ones, so how can that work? This is where specificity comes into play. The various Bootstrap classes that use these breakpoints have been designed so the ones for the larger breakpoints have a higher specificity than the ones for the smaller breakpoints. So, if you set styles for the medium breakpoint and for the large breakpoint, then while your viewport is wider than 992px both classes are in play, but the large one wins because it has a higher specificity. The moment you make your viewport narrower than 992px, the large class is no longer in play, so now the medium class takes over.

This probably sounds quite confusing and complicated, but don‚Äôt worry. Once you see it in action, it should make a lot more sense.

As we‚Äôll learn next time, many aspects of Bootstrap make use of these break points, but we‚Äôll start by examining their use with the Bootstrap grid.

## Layout Design Guidelines

Before we move on to look at how the Bootstrap grid makes use of breakpoints to support responsive design I want to give you two guidelines to bear in mind when designing responsive layouts. Note that **these are guidelines**, not rules!

### 1 ‚Äî Think Mobile First

The advice from the Bootstrap project is to think _mobile first_. That was their philosophy when designing the library, so you‚Äôll find your life less stressful if you align your philosophy with theirs!

What this means as that you generally get better results when you start by making your layout work on small screens, and then use Bootstrap‚Äôs responsive design features to make your mobile layout adapt well to larger screens.

### 2 ‚Äî Order Your Elements Semantically

As we‚Äôll learn, the visual order things appear on the page, and the order they appear in the source code do not have to be the same. The source code order should be such that the page can be read with all styles turned off, which is effectively how search engines and screens readers see it anyway. If your source starts with the footer, then has the sidebar, and only then the main content, it would look ridiculous with all CSS turned off. Hence, it reads stupidly to search engines and any assistive devices that are not CSS-aware.

## Breakpoints and the Bootstrap Grid

So far we‚Äôve learned that columns in the Bootstrap grid are defined using tags starting with `col`. Just `col` alone means an automatically sized column. `col-1` means a column one twelfth of the width of the container, `col-2` two twelfths, and so on. These classes all have an implicit breakpoint of `xs`, so they apply to all viewport widths.

There exist similar classes for each of the other four breakpoints, i.e. `col-md-4` means that the column should be four twelfths wide in all viewports that are at least 768px wide. There is also an automatic variant for each breakpoint, i.e. `col-sm`, `col-md`, `col-lg`, & `col-xl`.

Remember from last time that the full width of a container is 12, and that if a row contains more columns than fit, they wrap. If we combine these two facts with the break-point-specific `col` classes, we can create dynamic layouts. Let‚Äôs start with a simple example.

Take this very basic HTML as a starting point:

```html
<div class="container-fluid my-3 text-center">
    <div class="row px-1">
        <div class="col p-3 border rounded bg-primary">
            <code class="text-white">.col-12</code>
        </div>
        <div class="col p-3 border rounded bg-secondary">
            <code class="text-white">.col-12</code>
        </div>
        <div class="col p-3 border rounded bg-info">
            <code class="text-white">.col</code>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

(You‚Äôll find a full page with this code in [the ZIP](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pbs58.zip) or [here on GitHub](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bbusschots/pbs-resources/instalmentZips/pbs58.zip) as `pbs58a.html`.)

This code gives us 3 equal-width columns at all breakpoints because `col` implies `xs` which covers all viewports from 0px wide up.

Let‚Äôs assume that three columns is just too much on a phone in either orientation. So let‚Äôs make each column full width by default by changing them all from `col` to `col-12`.

We now have a working layout for all phones, but on tablets, that seems like a bad use of space. Tablets are not wide enough for three by three, but they can handle two columns. So let‚Äôs leave the first column full width and make the second two half-width by giving them the additional class `col-md-6`.

Now try to resize the window. For viewports narrower than 768px there are three full-width columns stacked on top of each other, but once your viewport becomes wider you get one full-width column followed by two half-width ones underneath.

While our layout is now fine on phones and tablets, it‚Äôs still wasteful of space on laptops and smaller desktops. So let‚Äôs make it into three equal-width columns for large devices by adding the class `col-lg` to each of the three columns.

Finally, on very wide-screened devices the sidebars are becoming wastefully large. So what we‚Äôd like is for the first and last columns to be limited to 3 in the extra large breakpoint by adding the class `col-xl-3` to both of them.

Your code should now look like this:

```html
<div class="container-fluid my-3 text-center">
    <div class="row px-1">
        <div class="col-12 col-lg col-xl-3 p-3 border rounded bg-primary">
            <code class="text-white">.col-12 .col-lg .col-xl-3</code>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg p-3 border rounded bg-secondary">
            <code class="text-white">.col-12 .col-md-6 .col-lg</code>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg col-xl-3 p-3 border rounded bg-info">
            <code class="text-white">.col-12 .col-md-6 .col-lg .col-xl-3</code>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

Starting with your window very narrow you‚Äôll get three vertically stacked columns. As you widen the window it will jump to two rows, one with one column, and one with two. As you widen the window more, it will jump again into three equal-width columns before finally jumping to a wider middle region between two narrower sidebars.

Welcome to the world of responsive design!

## Reordering Columns

I mentioned in the guidelines that the visual layout and the order of elements in your source code don‚Äôt need to be the same. Let‚Äôs look at how we can achieve that.

We‚Äôll examine this idea through a worked example ‚Äî a relatively simple but very commonly used page structure:

```html
<div class="container-fluid my-3 text-center">
    <header class="row px-1">
        <div class="col p-3 border rounded bg-primary">
            <h1 class="text-white">Page Header</h1>
        </div>
    </header>
    <div class="row px-1">
        <div class="col p-3 border rounded bg-info">
            <p class="text-white">Left Side Bar</p>
        </div>
        <main class="col p-3 border rounded bg-secondary">
            <p class="text-white">The main page content ...</p>
        </main>
        <div class="col p-3 border rounded bg-info">
            <p class="text-white">Right Side Bar</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <footer class="row px-1">
        <div class="col p-3 border rounded bg-light">
            <p class="text-dark">Page Footer</p>
        </div>
    </footer>
</div>
```

(You‚Äôll find the full file in [the ZIP](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pbs58.zip) or [here on GitHub](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bbusschots/pbs-resources/instalmentZips/pbs58.zip) as `pbs58c.html`.)

As you can see we have a full-width header, followed by the main content with a sidebar each side, followed by a full-width footer. As it stands, this page is not responsive.

A logical first start to making it responsive would be to make the three central columns full width by default by replacing the class `col` with `col-12`.

Scrolling down we now get the header, then the first sidebar, then the main content, then the second sidebar, and finally the footer. This is not actually the order we want ‚Äî the most important stuff should always come first so people are not needlessly scrolling!

The order of the code here does not follow our guidelines ‚Äî the main content should come before either sidebar. Let‚Äôs fix that by moving the left sidebar from before the main content to after it in the source.

This immediately makes things work properly in our mobile-friendly initial layout ‚Äî we now see the header, then the main content, then the two sidebars, and finally the footer.

If we now try make this behave properly on medium-sized devices (and larger) by adding `col-md-3` to each of the sidebars, we run into a problem: the main content area is where the left sidebar should be!

This is where Bootstrap‚Äôs reordering classes come in. Like I said, the visual order of columns in the grid does not have to be defined by their ordering within the markup. That‚Äôs just the default behaviour!

In Bootstrap all columns have an implicit _order_ of zero. Columns are sorted by _order_ first, and only when multiple columns share the same _order_ does their position within the markup come into play. By default, all columns have an _order_ of zero, so their order within the markup is what we see reflected visually in the page.

However, Bootstrap provides breakpoint-specific classes for altering the _order_ values of the columns for each of the breakpoints. So, to set the _order_ for a column to 2 for all breakpoints from medium up, you would use the class `order-md-2`. There are order classes from 1 to 12 for `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl`. There are also `order-1` to `order-12` classes with the implicit breakpoint of `xs`.

Finally, and very conveniently, there are also `order-XX-first` and `order-XX-last` classes for setting the a column‚Äôs _order_ to -1 and 13 respectively for each of the breakpoints.

In our example above, default ordering is working for all columns and breakpoints except one column for breakpoints from medium up. The left sidebar needs to move to the left of the main content area for those breakpoints. We can easily achieve that by giving that column the class `order-md-first`.

So, we now have a layout that meets best practice for assistive devices and SEO, and works well on both small and large screened devices:

```html
<div class="container-fluid my-3 text-center">
    <header class="row px-1">
        <div class="col p-3 border rounded bg-primary">
            <h1 class="text-white">Page Header</h1>
        </div>
    </header>
    <div class="row px-1">
        <main class="col-12 col-md p-3 border rounded bg-secondary">
            <p class="text-white">The main page content ...</p>
        </main>
        <div class="col-12 col-md-3 order-md-first p-3 border rounded bg-info">
            <p class="text-white">Left Side Bar</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 col-md-3 p-3 border rounded bg-info">
            <p class="text-white">Right Side Bar</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <footer class="row px-1">
        <div class="col p-3 border rounded bg-light">
            <p class="text-dark">Page Footer</p>
        </div>
    </footer>
</div>
```

## Challenge

Update your recipe so its markup is in a semantically sensible order, and so its layout works well at all five breakpoints.

## Final Thoughts

I intentionally skipped over all mentions of breakpoints when we took our first look at the Bootstrap utilities and the Bootstrap _content_ classes. Now that we‚Äôve learned about breakpoints, it‚Äôs time to circle back around at that previously ignored functionality.
