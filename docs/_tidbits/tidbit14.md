In a recent instalment of Allison's Chit Chat Across the Pond podcast we discussed my experiences with AI in general, and promised deeper dives into coding with AI and working on the terminal with AI. This the first of those promised deeper dives (the second will appear as an instalment of Taming the Terminal some time soon).

## Some Context

My AI Journey began in work where I agreed with my manager that I would be make time in 2025 to experiment with AI so I'd have the needed first-hand experience to have meaningful discussions around the topic in my role as a cybersecurity specialist. Because of this work setting I couldn't just do what ever I wanted, I needed to comply with all our policies, most importantly our data protection policies. With my programming hat on that meant confining myself to the enterprise versions of Microsoft's Copilot suite, specifically the general-purpose Microsoft 365 chat bot in my Edge sidebar, and GitHub Copilot in VS Code.

It's almost been a year now, and I've really come to enjoy having these two Copilots help me with my various bits of coding work. This year that's meant getting some assistance while working with:

1. Some Excel formulas
2. Some JSON processing with `jq`
3. A little shell scripting with Bash
4. A lot of data processing and dashboard creation in Azure Log Analytics Workspaces with KQL
5. A lot of PowerShell scripting
6. And even more Linux automation with Ansible which involves:
   1. Lots of YAML files defining custom Ansible components like roles and playbooks
   2. INI files defining inventories
   3. Jinja2 template strings all over the place

If that sounds like a lot of different technologies, and a lot of confusing context switching, you'd be absolute right!

Earlier in my career as a dogs-body sysadmin I generally got to immerse myself deeply in just one or two languages, initially Bash and Perl, then later NodeJS JavaScript, which meant almost everything I needed was generally fresh in my mind and I could work away with little need to reference documentation. But in my current role I need to jump from tool to tools multiple times a week, or even, a day. That kind of context switching gets really confusing really fast. I still have lots of knowledge and experience buried deep in my brain, but I need some help triggering the right memory at the right time, and having the appropriate CoPilot sitting right there in my sidebar has proven invaluable!

I really like Microsoft's naming choice here, because there is simply no way these AIs are even close to replacing skilled humans working on real-world mission-critical code, but they are capable of providing valuable assistance to help those skilled humans be more effective. Think of them as force multiplies, not replacements.
