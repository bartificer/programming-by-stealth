Way back in 2015 when myself and Allison started this series I made a point of evangelising the power of coding skills â€” when you can program, you can turn your ideas, big and small, into reality. Sometimes that results in substantial projects that take up years of your life, like XKPasswd, and sometimes that results in a simple little script written on a rainy morning on a whim for no reason other than that it sounded like fun. This little tidbit is mostly an example of that, but it's also a little reminder that PowerShell remains next on our agenda after we finish the Jekyll series, and as a second teaser for that trailer.

So what's with the odd title? It all has to do with a US TV game show I have literally never watched, and a math problem that breaks most people's intuition so thoroughly it's famous around the world â€” yes, I wanted to test my understanding of the [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) ðŸ˜€

## The Monty Hall Problem

Back in the 1970s Monty Hall was the legendary host of a US TV game show named *[Let's Make a Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Make_a_Deal)*. The show involved audience members having to choose to trade something they could see for something they couldn't. I don't t think the infamous scenario named for the show's host ever actually appeared on the TV show itself, but in 1975 a reader sent a letter (yea, letters passed for social media back then ðŸ˜‰) to *The American Statistician* magazine with a challenge we now know as *the Monty Hall Problem*:

> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

So, you have three doors, one with a new car, and two with dummy prizes, you pick a door, the host opens one of the wrong doors, and you get to choose to stick with your original choice, or to switch. Statistically, which choice gives you the best odds of winning the car?

Most people, me included, initially assume it's a toss-up, there was a one-in-three chance your first door was right, and a one-in-three chance the other door was right, so there's no difference â€” **WRONG!!!**

Switching actually **doubles** your chance of winning to two-in-three â€” huhâ€½â€½â€½ðŸ¤¯

The to understanding this is this little phrase in the original puzzle:  _"and the host, **who knows what's behind the doors**, opens another door"_. Your intuition that you had a 1-in-3 chance on your initial guess was perfectly correct, but unlike with two coin-flips that follow each other with are un-connected, the choice of the door to open is **not** un-connected, the host has added information into your understanding of the situation, which has changed the odds. The door that the host opens **never** contain the car, so the host did not have a 1-in-3 choice to make, in fact, if you guess right, the host has **zero** options, there is only one door you haven't already picked that has a goat behind it! Even if you initially picked wrong, there are only two doors you haven't picked, so the host is still not choosing from 1-in-3. That door you didn't pick the first time is now more likely to be the right answer than 1-in-3, so **you should switch**!

## Hmmm â€¦ I Guess â€¦ But Really?

Having listened to yet another mathematician refer to the Monty Hall Problem and how it shows we humans are predictably illogical in very specific ways, this problem was whirling around in my brain at the start of some annual leave as the rain was bucketing down outside and I had a barrel of fresh-brewed coffee and my laptop in front of me â€” why not just test this so I know, for sure, that the world behaves like I think it does. Let's throw together a script to play the game a few thousand times and count the successes for the three most obvious strategies:

1. Always stick to your original door
2. Always switch (a theory tells us we should)
3. Randomly stick or switch

A decade ago when I wanted to throw together a quick script I'd reach for Perl, five years ago, Node JS CLI JavaScript, but today, PowerShell!

So, with a little help from the GitHub and Office365 Copilot AI bots, I threw together a script before my coffee was empty â€” that's why coding is a superpower ðŸ™‚

I had a quick and dirty result very quickly, but then it struck me that if I carried on a little bit and tidied it up, refactored it a little to bring it in line with best practices, then I'd have some fun content to talk to Allison about, hence, this TidBit!

## PowerShell Meets Monty Hall

Before we look at the code, I want to stress that this final script is not a *quick-and-dirty* hack, it's a best-practices little script that shows how to write **good robust PowerShell** rather than short and quick PowerShell. Your PowerShell doesn't need to be this long to work once, but if you want something maintainable that will do it's job reliably, then this is how you want to use PowerShell.

### Random Considerations

Before I wrote one character of PowerShell I spent a little time thinking about getting some really high quality random numbers for this exercise â€” this is all about testing probabilities, so they last thing I wanted was now-quality random numbers invalidating my results!

So, I actually started by checking on the current state of Random.Org's free web API by [reading their docs](https://www.random.org/clients/http/).

Key points:

1. There still is a free HTTP-based API that can generate random integers within a given range
2. The free API is rate-limited in two ways:
   1. You can get a maximum of 10,000 random integers per query
   2. If your IP address makes *too many* queries you'll get block-listed, so play nice!

OK, so that's what the API can provide, what do I actually need?

Well, to run a single simulation I need to make four random choices:

1. Monty chooses a door to hide the car behind (integer between 1 & 3 inclusive)
2. Choose one of three doors as my initial guess (integer between 1 & 3 inclusive)
3. Monty chooses a wrong door to open, might have zero choices, but might have to pick between two (integer between 1 & 2 inclusive)
4. For the random strategy, need to make a boolean choice to stick or switch (integer between 1 & 2 inclusive)

So, I need two random numbers between 1 and 3, and two between 1 and 2 for each simulation. I chose to make two calls to the API per run of the script:

1. Ask for 10,000 random integers between 1 & 3 (`https://www.random.org/integers/?num=10000&min=1&max=3&col=1&base=10&format=plain&rnd=new`)
2. Ask for 10,000 random integers between 1 and 2 (`https://www.random.org/integers/?num=10000&min=1&max=2&col=1&base=10&format=plain&rnd=new`)

Breaking those URLs down, the parameters are:

* `num` is the number of random integers being requested
* `min` is the lowest allowed random value
* `max` is the highest allowed random value
* `col` is the number of columns to organise the output into (`1` means one number per line)
* `base` is the numbering system to use (base 10 as opposed to binary or hexadecimal in this case)
* `format` can be either `html` to see the results on a web page, or `plain` to get the random numbers as plain text.
* `rnd=new` is what the docs say to use when you want truly random numbers (there are other options for the rare situations you want something more complex like a deterministic random sequence or intentionally pseudo-random numbers)

All in all this gave me a nice balance between quality and quantity â€” the script can run up to 5,000 high quality simulations per execution.
