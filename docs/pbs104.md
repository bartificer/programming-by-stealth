# PBS 104 of X — Tracking Changes in Git

So far in this mini series we've looked at the larger landscape of version control, we've explained why we've chosen the distributed version control system Git for this series, and we've learned how to make our first Git repository and add some files to it.

In this instalment we'll take things one step further and learn how to manage changes to our files.

PLAYER HERE

## Playing Along

If you're like to play along with the examples you'll need to download this instalment's ZIP file, extract the folder `pbs104a`, change into it in a terminal, and execute the following commands to initialise it as a git repository with all the files added:

```
cd pbs104a
git init
[ `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` = 'master' ] && git checkout -b main
git add .
git commit -m "initial version"
```

The majority of those commands are straight from the previous instalment, but notice that the optional command for re-naming `master` to `main` as needed with older versions of `git` has been pre-fixed with some additional logic. Since this is Programming by Stealth rather than Taming the Terminal I won't go into detail of exactly how that command works, instead, I suggest you save it for future use, perhaps in your text expansion utility of choice.

Having said that, for anyone who's curious, the terminal command for conditionally re-naming `master` to `main` makes use of the following commands/concepts:

1. the [POSIX `test` command](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/test.html)
2. the `git symbolic-ref` command (`man git-symbolic-ref`)
3. So-called [*Lazy Evaluation*](http://wresch.github.io/2014/04/24/bash-short-circuit-evaluation.html) to only execute  the `git checkout` command when the current branch is `master`. 

## Some House-Keeping for Mac Users — Globally Ignore `.DS_Store` Files

To avoid macOS's hidden `.DS_STORE` files getting in our way we need to configure git to globally ignore those files. We'll explain these commands in detail in a future instalment, but for now, we'll simply make the change without digging into the detail.

Firstly, if you've already a Git user and you have a global ignore file set up already, do not follow these instructions! Instead, edit your existing file and make sure it includes the line: `**/.DS_Store`

You can see if you have an existing global ignore file with the `git config` command we learned about in the previous instalment:

```
git config --global core.excludesfile || echo 'NONE'
```

This will either show the path to your excludes file or `NONE`.

To create a global excludes file that ignores all `.DS_Store` files everywhere simply run:

```
echo '**/.DS_Store' >> ~/.gitignore_global
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

You can verify that the change has taken effect by re-running `git config --global core.excludesfile || echo 'NONE'`.

## Staging & Committing A Simple Change

For once, the typo in the first sentence of `index.html` is not a mistake, I intentionally put it there so we could correct it 🙂

Open `README.md` in your favourite text editor and correct *'example **is** instalment'* to *'example **in** instalment'*.

Once the typo is fixed `git status` will show we have one un-staged change:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs104a bart% git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
bart-imac2018:pbs104a bart%
```

Git is again being helpful, and letting us know that we can add our change to the staging area in the same way entirely new files are staged, with the `git add` command. 

Go ahead and stage the change with:

```
git add README.md
```

If we run `git status` again we can see that our change has been successfully staged and is ready to be committed:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs104a bart% git status
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   README.md

bart-imac2018:pbs104a bart%
```

Like we did last week, we can now commit our staged change, along with a sensible commit message, with a command like:

```
git commit -m 'Fixed silly typo in README'
```

## Staging & Committing Multiple Changes

Let's make a more substantial change to our wee project, let's edit our HTML file to use a local copy of Bootstrap 4.

This involves editing both adding new files (a `contrib` folder containing Bootstrap's CSS and license file), and editing our existing `index.html`.

To play along at home copy the contents of the folder `pbs104a-v2` into your repository, replacing `index.html` when asked.

Once you've updated the files, you can see all the un-staged changes with `git status`:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs104a bart% git status                            
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   index.html

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	contrib/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
bart-imac2018:pbs104a bart% 
```

Before we do anything else, let's stage the new `contrib` folder:

```
git add contrib
```

Now, we know from `git status` that we have made changes to `index.html` but how do we see the actual changes we made?

## Seeing Changes with `git diff`

To see the un-staged changes to a file use the command `git diff PATH/TO/FILE`, for example, to see the changes to `index.html` use:

```
git diff index.html
```

This will show all the changes in a command line pager appropriate for your OS, on Linux/Unix/Mac that will probably be  either the `less` or `more` terminal commands. Basically, `diff` will behave like `man`, allowing you to navigate up and down with the arrow keys, and to exit the pager by pressing `q`.

If you'd prefer not to use a pager and simply have all the changes printed to the terminal directly, use the `--no-pager` flag:

```
git --no-pager diff index.html
```

Notice that the `--no-pager` flag applies to the `git` command as a whole, not to the `diff` sub-command, so it goes between `git` and `diff`. As we'll see later, this flag can be used with many `git` subcommands, not just `diff`.

The format of the output takes some getting used to. New and changed lines are shown pre-fixed with `+` symbols, and deleted and old versions of changed lines are shows pre-fixed with `-` symbols. A few lines of un-changed content are shown around the changed lines for context, and there's some metadata shown too.

Note that the `git diff` command can be used to compare versions across commits and branches as well. For details see [the relevant section of the documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) or `man git-diff`.

Most Git users don't look at their changes on the command line, this is where Git GUIs really come into their own. Every Git GUI will allow you to see the changes to your files in a visual way. You may recognise some similarities to this terminal output though.

Let's go ahead and stage the modified index.html and commit our changes:

```
git add index.html
git commit -m 'Moved from plain HTML to Bootstrap'
```

## Dividing Changes Into Separate Commits

In an ideal world we would make one logical group of changes, commit it, then move on to something else, but in reality, we don't work like that. We see an easy fix in a function next to the one we're working on, so we fix that, or we spot a typo, or we change our mind of the wording of some error message we see in adjacent code. Or, probably the most common of all, we get into a flow and simply forget to commit! The end results is that we often have multiple logical changes in our working copy at the same time, and we really should commit them as multiple separate commits.

Git's staging area was designed to address this inevitable reality. Conceptually, the approach is very simple, stage one set of changes, commit those, then stage the next, and commit those, and continue until everything is committed. When each logical grouping of changes affects separate files, that's easy to do, but you can still do it when your changes are intermixed within the same files.

### The Simple Case — Changes to Separate Files

To play along, copy both `index.html` and `README.md` from the `pbs104a-v3` folder in this instalment's ZIP into your repository (replacing the current versions of the files).

As we can see from `git status`, there are two changed files:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs104a bart% git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   README.md
	modified:   index.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
bart-imac2018:pbs104a bart%
```

These updated files contain two changes, a description of the *Hello World* meme in `index.html`, and the inclusion of Bootstrap licensing information in `README.md`.

Let's first stage and commit the licensing info:

```
git add README.md
git commit -m 'Added Bootstrap licensing info to README'
```

As we can see with `git status`, we still have one more un-staged and un-committed change:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs104a bart% git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   index.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
bart-imac2018:pbs104a bart%
```

Let's now stage and commit that:

```
git add index.html
git commit -m 'Added link to Wikipedia article on the Hello World meme'
```

### Separately Staging Changes to a Single File

To play along, copy `index.html` from the `pbs104a-v4` folder in this instalment's ZIP into your repository (replacing the existing version).

This file contains two sets of edits — firstly the page has been re-worked to move the heading and the lead paragraph into a semantic `header` tag, and a footer has been added. Secondly, my programming history in different hello worlds has been added into the `main` tag.

You can explore these changes with `git diff index.html` or using your favourite Git GUI.

We want to stage these two logical sets of changes as two separate commits. The key to doing this is Git's ability to treat each edit to a file as a separate change, referred to as a *hunk*. Git GUIs will let you graphically stage individual hunks, but you can also do it from the terminal by using `git add` with the `--patch` (or just `-p` for short) flag. When you use this flag you'll be shown each change one-by-one, and you hit `y` to stage it or `n` not to. Let's step through the changes to `index.html` with:

```
git add --patch index.html
```
Git will offer you the changes at different granularities. In this case,  the first hunk offered covers all the changes. We need to drill down deeper, so we can do that by splitting the hunk by entering `s` and hitting return. We will then be offered a hunk for the inclusion of the header tag, so we want to accept that by hitting `y` and then return. Next we're offered the closing `header` tag and the opening `main` tag, we want that too, so hit `y` and return again. Next we're offered the entire programming history as a hunk, we don't want this so hit `n` and return. Finally, we're offered the new `footer` tag, which we do want, so hit `y` and return on that.

We have now staged some of our changes to `index.html`, but not others, so the file is both staged and un-staged, as you can see with `git status`:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs104a bart% git status
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   index.html

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   index.html

bart-imac2018:pbs104a bart%
```

We can use `git diff index.html` to see our un-staged changes, but how do we see our staged changes? We can use the `--cached` flag to do that, i.e. `git diff --cached index.html`.

Using the `--no-pager` flag we can output both sets of changes to terminal like so:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs104a bart% git --no-pager diff index.html
diff --git a/index.html b/index.html

Running `git status` again you can see we're now down to just un-staged changes in one file, and no staged changes:

We can now stage and commit our last change (my history of programming) as normal:

```
git add index.html
git commit -m 'Added my history of programming in Hello World programs'
```

## Viewing Our Commits

We'll dive into this in more detail in the next instalment, but to quickly see all our commits we can use the `git log` command. If we give it no arguments it will show all our commits in reverse order in a pager. Like with `git diff` we can force direct output to the terminal with the `--no-pager` flag:

```

## Final Thoughts

Our Git journey is progressing nicely. We can now create repositories, add files to them, and track our changes to those files.

In the next instalment we'll start by learning how to explore our repository's history, and, how to time-travel by checking out older commits.
