# PBS 8 of X ‚Äì CSS Positioning

In [the previous instalment](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs7) we learned about the CSS box model. Each HTML tag is represented as a box within the browser. Those boxes stack down the page and inside each other to build up the web pages we see. We also learned how to use FireFox‚Äôs developer tools to actually see and inspect the boxes. In this instalment we‚Äôll learn how to take one or more boxes out of the normal flow of the page, and position them elsewhere on the page.

## Grouping HTML Tags

So far, we have looked at HTML tags for defining individual components of a page ‚Äì headings, paragraphs, lists, images, etc. We have not yet looked at grouping them into related chunks of any kind.

HTML 5 has really changed how we define regions within our HTML documents. There are two big advantages to using the new HTML 5 tags ‚Äì they help screen readers better understand your page, and they make it easier to style your page with CSS, allowing you to use more human-friendly selectors.

HTML5 has introduced the concept of sectioning tags. These tags have no visible effect on the page without CSS, but they can be used to group chunks of related content within a page.

### Sections & Articles

If you have a regular page with multiple logical sections, you can use the `<section>` tag to surround each section. You can also nest `<section>` tags inside other `<section>` tags if your content has logical subsections.

For pages that contain multiple independent pieces of content like blogs or new sites, the `<article>` tag should be used instead of the `<section>` tag. Think of an article is a piece of content that could be syndicated, like a blog post or a news story. If something only makes sense in context, it is probably a section. If it can stand alone, it is probably an article.

### Figures and Asides

The `<aside>` tag can be used to contain content that‚Äôs tangentially related to the content of a section or article. Something is an aside only if the main content still makes sense without it.

Similar, but a little different, are figures. A figure can be a collection of images, a code sample, or something like that, whose position within the document does not have to be fixed, but without which the main content does not make sense.

The `<figure>` tag is used to encapsulate figures. Figures can optionally contain a single caption within a `<figcaption>` tag.

### Navigation Areas

A region containing navigation links, like you‚Äôll often find in a page header or side bar, should be contained within a `<nav>` tag.

### Headers, Footers, and Main Content Regions

As well as the sectioning tags above, HTML 5 also introduced three tags for defining regions that are not sections as such. The first two are `<header>` and `<footer>`, which can be used to group a number of tags together to define page and article header and footer regions.

HTML 5 also introduced the `<main>` tag. This tag can be used to markup the unique content on a page. Imagine a typical page on a typical website ‚Äì the core content of any page does not make up the entire page. There will be ‚Äòfluff‚Äô like headers, footers, sidebars, menu bars, and so on that surround the core content. The `<main>` tag is used to mark the part of the page where the core content is located. This tag is particularly useful for screen readers, making life much easier for the vision impaired visiting your site.

A web page can only contain a single `<main>` tag. That single `<main>` tag cannot be contained within any of the sectioning tags, that is to say, it cannot be contained within any of following tags: `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<figure>`, `<footer>`, `<header>`, or `<nav>`.

### Generic Grouping Tags

Finally, even before HTML 5, there were two generic tags for grouping content ‚Äì `<div>` is the generic block-level grouping tag, and `<span>` is the generic inline grouping tag.

## Sizing Boxes

Before we move on to positioning boxes, it‚Äôs worth noting that we can control the size of the box for each tag with CSS. The `width` and `height` properties specify the dimensions of the content region of a box. The default value is `auto`, which means the box will expand and contract based on its content, and the type of box that it is. The boxes for inline tags will be as tall and wide as their content, while the boxes for regular block-level tags will be the full width of the containing box, and the height of their content. Widths and heights can be set to specific values using any of the CSS dimensions (e.g. `500px`, or `4em`), or to a percentage of the width or height of the containing box.

As well as specifying exact sizes, it is also possible to leave the width and/or height set to `auto`, and constrain the size of the box within a range using the `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height`, and `max-height` properties.

Finally, for block-level elements with a `width` other than `auto`, it‚Äôs possible to set the left and right margins or padding to `auto`, which will effectively centre the content region of the box.

You can see an example of this approach in the demo at the bottom of this instalment. The `<figure>` tag is given a width of `75%`, a padding of `5px`, a top and bottom margin of `10px`, and a left an right margin of `auto`:

```css
figure{
  text-align: center;
  width: 75%;
  margin: 10px auto;
  padding: 5px;
  border-top: 1px dotted DarkGrey;
  border-bottom: 1px dotted DarkGrey;
}
```

As you can see in the screenshot below, this results in figures being centred regions 75% the width of the main content region of the page:

![Example Use of Auto margins](../assets/pbs8/Screen-Shot-2016-02-03-at-10.59.42-e1454497285619.png)

### Overflowing boxes

When constraining the dimensions of boxes, or when including very long unbreakable content (big images, or text with really long ‚Äòwords‚Äô like giant URLs), it is possible for the content not to fit inside its box. When this happens the browser has a few options: it can simply overflow the box, showing the content poking out of whatever side of the box it does not fit within, or it can truncate the content, hiding whatever does not fit in the box, or, it can add scroll bars to the box.

The behaviour in case of overflow is controlled by the `overflow-x` and `overflow-y` properties. `overflow-x` tells the browser what to do when content overflows out of the left or right edge of a box, and `overflow-y` what to do when content overflows out of the top or bottom of a box. There is also a shorthand property `overflow` which sets both overflows to the same value.

The following values are valid for overflows:

<dl>
<dt><code>visible</code></dt>

<dd>The overflowed content is shown beyond the edges of the box ‚Äì this is the default.</dd>

<dt><code>hidden</code></dt>

<dd>The overflowing content is hidden, that is to say, the overflow is clipped.</dd>


<dt><code>scroll</code></dt>

<dd>Scroll bars are always added to the box.</dd>


<dt><code>auto</code></dt>

<dd>Scrollbars are added only when needed.</dd>

</dl>

## CSS Positioning

By default, the block-level tags that make up a web page are stacked one below the other, reaching out to the full width of the container. Nested tags are stacked within the content region of the box for the block-level tag they are contained within. I like to think of them as little helium balloons ‚Äì floating up, and spreading out to the full available width.

The helium analogy does break down when you consider the z-axis though ‚Äì the way it works with nested boxes is that the parent box is behind the boxes it contains. This makes sense if you think about it, because otherwise you couldn‚Äôt put backgrounds on boxes that contain other boxes.

This is the normal flow of a page. CSS positioning is about taking individual tags, and pulling them out of the normal flow of the page, and placing them somewhere else within the page.

### Floats

The simplest form of positioning is floating. Any block-level tag can be floated left or right using the `float` attribute. Because it makes no sense to float an inline tag, inline tags get converted to block-level tag when floated.

The float property can have three values ‚Äì `none`, `left`, or `right`, with `none` being the default. When a tag has its `float` property set to either `left` or `right`, it is removed from the normal flow of the page, so the block elements above and below come together. The floated box then floats over the boxes of the unfloated tags moving left or right until it hits either the edge of another floating box, or the edge of the content region of the box containing the floated box.

While floated boxes sit in front of the boxes in the normal flow of the document, the content within those underlying boxes flows around the edges of the floated box. Think of it like floating an image in a word document, the text flows around the image.

Floated boxes can overflow the bottom of the box they are contained by.

Every box in the normal flow of the document can decide whether or not to allow a float from a box above it to penetrate into it or not. If it is set not to allow penetration, a gap will be left in the normal flow of the document. This behaviour is referred to as _clearing floats,_ and the CSS property that controls this behaviour is `clear`.

The `clear` property can have one of four values, `none`, `left`, `right`, and `both`, with `none` being the default. When `clear` is set to `none`, all floats are allowed to protrude into the top of the box. When `clear` is set to `left`, no left-floated boxes are allowed to protrude into the top of the box, but right-floated boxes are. Similarly, when `clear` is set to `right`, no right-floated boxes are allowed to protrude into the top of the box, but left-floated boxes are. And finally, when `clear` is set to `both`, no floats are allowed to protrude into the top of the box.

The clear property is about defining what tags should move down below all floats before starting. It is quite normal to set `clear` to `both` on heading tags like `<h1>`, and on sectioning tags like `<section>` and `<article>`. Paragraphs on the other hand, would almost always be left at the default value of `none`.

Normally, floats will poke out of the bottom of boxes, and the clear property will not prevent that. If you have a box with a background and/or border, you really don‚Äôt want floats poking out the bottom, it will look terrible! In that situation you really want the box to extend downward to encapsulate the floats it contains. There is no official way of doing this in CSS, but there are two hacks commonly used to work around this shortcoming.

The first is particularly unpleasant because it breaks the separation between content and presentation ‚Äì a completely empty `<div>` can be added at the end of the box to be extended around the floats, and the `clear` property can be set to `none` on that `<div>`.

The second, preferable but still suboptimal, solution is to set the `overflow` property on the box containing the floats to `auto`. This will cause the box to extend around the floats. If, however, the box contains overly long unbreakable content, scroll bars will appear, and that may not be what you want or expect.

You can see an example of this technique in use in the demo at the bottom of this instalment. The little business card in the top of the side bar is a box with a border and background, and it contains a floated image. Without setting the `overflow` to `auto`, it would look like this:

![Overflowing Float Example](../assets/pbs8/Screen-Shot-2016-02-03-at-11.06.53.png)

Notice how the image is poking slightly outside the border, and how the padding has been completely lost around the bottom of the image. It just does not look right!

However, by simply setting the `overflow` property of the yellow box to `auto`, we get the following, much more pleasing result:

![Contained Float Example](../assets/pbs8/Screen-Shot-2016-02-03-at-11.09.21.png)

### Positioned Boxes

Another way to remove boxes from the normal flow of the page and move them elsewhere is by setting the `position` property.

The default value for this property is `static` ‚Äì that is to say, the tag is either rendered in the normal flow of the page or floated. A box with a `position` of `static` is said to be _unpositioned_, and conversely, a box with a `position` other than `static` is said to be _positioned_.

Tags with their `position` set to `fixed` are taken out of the normal flow of the document, and placed above the boxes that remain within the normal flow, and positioned relative to the browser window.

The attributes that control the position of boxes with a position of fixed are `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`, and they specify the distance between the relevant side of the screen, and relevant edge of the positioned box. So, if `top` is set to `10px`, and `left` to `10px`, then the box will be positioned 10 pixels down from the top of the screen, and 10 pixels in from the left. The size of the box can then be controlled using the `width` and `height` properties, or if the `width` and/or `height` are set to `auto`, by specifying the offset on two opposite sides.

For example, to position a `<div>` with the ID `top_banner` as a 10-pixel high banner across the whole top of the screen you would set:

```css
div#top_banner{
  position: fixed;
  top: 0px;
  left: 0px;
  right: 0px;
  height: 10px;
}
```

As you scroll, an element with `position` set to `fixed` will not move with the page.

Similar to setting the `position` to `fixed`, when you set the position to `absolute`, the box is taken out of the normal flow of the document, and its position controlled by top, right, bottom, and left, but in this case, relative to nearest containing positioned box. If there is no containing positioned box, the position is relative to the body tag.

The big difference is that, with `position` set to `absolute`, the box **does** scroll with the page.

Finally, position can be set to `relative`. In this case, a placeholder for the box is left in place within the normal flow of the document, but the actual box is rendered offset from its normal position by the values set in `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and/or `left`.

Offsetting a position is not something you need to do often, but, setting `position` to `relative` without specifying an offset has a very useful side effect ‚Äì it turns the box into a positioned box, so boxes within that box with a `position` of `absolute` now use it as the base for their `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` offsets.

Finally ‚Äì the vertical stacking of positioned boxes can be controlled with the `z-index` property. Remember, the vertical stacking of unpositioned boxes is controlled by the nesting of the tags within the normal flow of the document, so the `z-index` property has no effect on unpositioned boxes.

The `z-index` property can either be set to `auto`, where its `z-index` is the same as that of its containing box, or, to a positive or negative whole number. Boxes with bigger `z-index` values are in front of those with smaller `z-index` values.

## Worked Example

All this sounds very complicated, so let‚Äôs tie it together with an example.

In this example we have a page with four main components ‚Äì the main content region, a header, a footer, and a side bar. The header and footer are contained within `<header>` and `<footer>` tags, and between those two tags there is a `<div>` with the ID `central_region` which contains the middle section of the page. The central region `<div>` contains the main content wrapped in a `<main>` tag, and then the side bar as a `<div>` with the ID `sidebar`. The main content is broken into two articles, one with demo figures, and one with demo asides.

The header and footer are unpositioned, as is the main content region. The div containing the entire central region is positioned relative, so it is shown in its normal position, but it acts as the base of the coordinate system for absolutely positioned boxes within it. The main content is positioned normally, but with a `220px` left margin. This wide margin creates an empty space into which the side bar is then placed by positioning it absolutely.

As usual, you can download a zip file with all the files needed for the example [here](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pbs8.zip) or [here on GitHub](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bbusschots/pbs-resources/instalmentZips/pbs8.zip). Extract these files and place them in a folder called `pbs8` in the document root of your web server, and of course, remember to start your web server. You should now be able to browse to the example at `http://localhost/pbs8/`.

## Conclusions

Now that we have learned about positioning, we have covered most of the CSS fundamentals ‚Äì we‚Äôre not quite done with CSS though ‚Äì there are still a few loose ends to tie up, which we‚Äôll do in the next instalment.
