# PBS 37 of x ‚Äì JSDoc Demo

In this instalment we take a break from what we‚Äôve been doing to take an in-depth look at code documentation. I‚Äôve regularly included documentation generated with JSDoc as one of the inputs to the challenges; and I‚Äôve done so with the implicit assumption that those docs would be intuitively meaningful to you all. Talking with Allison, two things became clear to me ‚Äì firstly, that I had made this implicit assumption, and secondly, that it was completely wrong! Code documentation is a lot like `man` pages on the terminal ‚Äì the structure of how the words are presented often carry as much meaning as the words themselves. With decades of experience this is obvious, but it‚Äôs not intuitively obvious to novices.

To remedy this, I thought it would be useful to go through the entire cycle of documenting one function, and that the appropriate format for that was a screencast. When I sat down to record the screencast, I couldn‚Äôt help but use the opportunity to share my toolkit with you all. So the screencast starts with a little demo of the development tools I‚Äôm currently using to develop the Cellular Automaton API we‚Äôre working on as part of this series.

Below you‚Äôll find the screencast embedded, and links to the various tools mentioned. Myself and Allison have also recorded a podcast for this instalment. I share my screen with Allison, and we walk through all the same steps as I do in the screencast, but with Allison stopping me and asking all the questions you probably have as you watch the screencast. When published, that podcast will be linked into this post.
